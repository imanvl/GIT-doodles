abstract = {Recently, Hi-C has been used to probe the 3D chromatin architecture of multiple organisms and cell types. The resulting collections of pairwise contacts across the genome have connected chromatin architecture to many cellular phenomena, including replication timing and gene regulation. However, high resolution (10 kb or finer) contact maps remain scarce due to the expense and time required for collection. A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. We describe Rambutan, a deep convolutional neural network that predicts Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. Specifically, Rambutan identifies locus pairs that engage in high confidence contacts according to Fit-Hi-C, a previously described method for assigning statistical confidence estimates to Hi-C contacts. We first demonstrate Rambutan's performance across chromosomes at 1 kb resolution in the GM12878 cell line. Subsequently, we measure Rambutan's performance across six cell types. In this setting, the model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7662 and 0.8246 and an area under the precision-recall curve between 0.3737 and 0.9008. We further demonstrate that the predicted contacts exhibit expected trends relative to histone modification ChIP-seq data, replication timing measurements, and annotations of functional elements such as promoters and enhancers. Finally, we predict Hi-C contacts for 53 human cell types and show that the predictions cluster by cellular function.},

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35{\%} on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path towards smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.},

abstract = {We use a unique security-level data set to analyze whether German banks use their customer portfolios and affiliated mutual funds as an exit channel for risky sovereign bonds in the European sovereign debt crisis. Matching banks� proprietary holdings with the holdings of their funds and their retail customers for the period 2009-2016 at the security level, we find evidence that banks sold off risky Euro area sovereign bonds to both their retail customers and their affiliated mutual funds during the European sovereign debt crisis. For the mutual funds, the sell-offs were more pronounced to public funds compared to special funds dedicated to institutional investors. Overall, this enabled banks with affiliated mutual funds to sell off larger amounts of their risky sovereign bond holdings, while bank-affiliated mutual funds acquired more risky sovereign bonds compared to their unaffiliated peers. Our findings have important implications. First, they suggest that there is a severe conflict of interest between banks� own account trading and the asset and wealth management services they offer to retail investors, potentially calling for better consumer protection. At the same time our findings also show that the severity of fire-sale contagion depends on the organizational structure of the financial sector.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data.We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most traditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is a convolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 fold speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on the 2013 BRATS test data-set reveal that our architecture improves over the currently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster.},

We find no sign of algorithm aversion: Investors care about returns, but do not have strong preferences which intermediary obtains these returns.

However, we find that investors are unable to fully separate skill and luck when evaluating either intermediary.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {In this short paper, we introduce an Excel data set which could be used to design various data cases when teaching Corporate Finance, Investments and Portfolio Theory. The structure of the data set is the simplest with just three columns: ID, Date and Value. The data set includes monthly adjusted closing price for over 200 stocks, several indices such as S{\&}P500, CPI, GDP growth rate, unemployment rate, Fama-French three factors plus the momentum factor. After explaining the Excel double matching function, we show how to "retrieve" data for a given set of tickers (IDs) such as IBM, AAPL, WMT, SP500, FTSE, Rf, SMB and HML, to form a return matrix which is critical for our further analysis. In addition, we discuss how to convert monthly returns to annual ones. Another beauty of the data set is that anyone could update it since all data items came from public sources.},

In our model, a bank can increase the risk of its asset portfolio (“risk shift”), convert bank assets to the personal benefit of the bank manager (“loot”), or do both. A regulator has three policy tools: it can restrict the bankʼs investment choices; it can make looting more costly; and it can force banks to hold more equity. Capital regulation may increase looting, and in extreme cases even risk shifting. Looting penalties reduce both looting and risk-shifting.},

GAL takes varieties of input types ranging from raw Fasta files to fully annotated files, processes them through a standard annotation pipeline and visualizes on a web browser. Comparative genomic analysis is performed automatically within a given taxonomic class. GAL creates interactive genome browser with clickable genomic feature tracks; local BLAST-able database; query page, on-fly downstream data analysis using EMBOSS etc. Overall, GAL is an extremely convenient, portable and platform independent. Fully integrated web-resources can be easily created and deployed, e.g. www.eumicrobedb.org/cglab, for our in-house genomes. GAL is freely available at https://hub.docker.com/u/cglabiicb/.},

We use a non-parametric technique, the Kernel density estimator, applied to a data set from the Italian National Institute for Social Security (INPS), consisting in 12 cohorts of new manufacturing firms followed for 6 years. Since the patterns of convergence to the limit distribution are different between industries, we conclude that the model of passive learning is consistent with some of them, the active exploration model with others, the evolutionary model with all of them.},

We consider the results of published formal replication studies (whether they are negating or reinforcing) and their extent: Narrow replication studies are typically devoted to mere replication of prior work, while scientific replication studies provide a broader analysis. We find evidence that higher-impact articles and articles by authors from leading institutions are more likely to be replicated, whereas the replication probability is lower for articles that appeared in top 5 economics journals. Our analysis also suggests that mandatory data disclosure policies may have a positive effect on the incidence of replication.},

abstract = {We develop a model of financially constrained arbitrage, and use it to study the dynamics of arbitrage capital, liquidity, and asset prices. Arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies between assets traded in segmented markets, and in doing so provide liquidity to investors. A collateral constraint limits their positions as a function of capital. We show that the dynamics of arbitrage activity are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes arbitrage capital, profitability increases, and this allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more and recover faster for more volatile trades, although arbitrageurs cut their positions in these trades the least. When arbitrage capital is more mobile across markets, liquidity in each market generally becomes less volatile, but the reverse may hold for aggregate liquidity because of mobility-induced contagion.},

The model captures much of the history of stock prices from consumption data. It explains the short‐and long‐run equity premium puzzles despite a low and constant risk‐free rate. The results are essentially the same whether we model stocks as a claim to the consumption stream or as a claim to volatile dividends poorly corelated with consumption. The model is driven by an independently and identically distributed consumption growth process and adds a slow ‐moving external habit to the standard power utility function. These features generate slow countercyclical variation in risk premia. The model posits a fundamentally novel description of risk premia.

Specifically, using classification algorithms and a sample consisting of the Item 4.01 text of 8-K documents, which provides information on changes in auditors of companies that are registered with the SEC, we predict the sign of the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) around 8-K filing dates. We report the correct classification performance and time efficiency of the classification algorithms. Our results show some improvement over the na{\"{i}}ve classification method.},

However, if margin levels are proportional to volatility, then a spike in volatility leads to potentially destabilizing margin calls in times of market stress. Risk-sensitive margin requirements are thus procyclical in the sense that they amplify shocks. We use a GARCH model of volatility and a combination of theoretical and empirical results to analyze how much higher margin levels need to be to avoid procyclicality while reducing counterparty credit risk. Our analysis compares the tail decay of conditional and unconditional loss distributions with comparable stable and risk-sensitive margin requirements. Greater persistence and burstiness in volatility leads to a slower decay in the tail of the unconditional distribution and a higher buffer needed to avoid procyclicality. The tail decay drives other measur...},

Our results demonstrate that a subsidiary's reduction in lending is strongly related to its parent bank's lending via the interbank market. While subsidiaries that were dependent on interbank financing increased their credit supply prior to the crisis, they reduced their lending activities during the crisis. Additionally, we observe that interbank-dependent subsidiaries tried to change their funding strategy when they were unable to increase their deposit growth significantly during the crisis. During the crisis, subsidiaries could not rely on their parent banks' support via the interbank market and encountered problems in attracting new depositors, which could explain the significant decline in lending during the financial crisis. These findings highlight the need to regulate and monitor multinational funding strategies, especially in the interbank market.},

(pedro.cuadros@cunef.edu) CUNEF and Funcas Rodr{\'{i}}guez-Fern{\'{a}}ndez, Francisco (franrod@ugr.es) Abstract This study examines the sequence of decisions that bank customers follow to adopt digital services and diversify the use of those services. The sequential approach relies on a random forest model applied to an in-depth survey on consumer preferences for financial services. The results show that the adoption of digital banking services starts with information-based services (e.g. checking account balance), and it is then followed by transactional services (e.g. online or mobile money transfer). However, the diversification of the use of online channels is mainly explained by the consciousness about the range services available and the perception that they are safe. The findings also reveal that bank customers adopt non-bank payment services only once they are frequent and diversified digital bank customers. This suggests a certain degree of complementary between bank and non-bank digital channels. The random forest model is shown results to outperform the forecasting accuracy of parametric econometric models. JEL classification: G21, O33},

abstract = {Machine learning models often excel in the accuracy of their predictions but are opaque due to their non-linear and non-parametric structure. This makes statistical inference challenging and disqualifies them from many applications where model interpretability is crucial. This paper proposes the Shapley regression framework as an approach for statistical inference on non-linear or non-parametric models. Inference is performed based on the Shapley value decomposition of a model, a pay-off concept from cooperative game theory. I show that universal approximators from machine learning are estimation consistent and introduce hypothesis tests for individual variable contributions, model bias and parametric functional forms. The inference properties of state-of-the-art machine learning models - like artificial neural networks, support vector machines and random forests - are investigated using numerical simulations and real-world data. The proposed framework is unique in the sense that it is identical to the conventional case of statistical inference on a linear model if the model is linear in parameters. This makes it a well-motivated extension to more general models and strengthens the case for the use of machine learning to inform decisions.},

abstract = {We model asset encumbrance by banks subject to rollover risk and study the consequences for fragility, funding costs, and prudential regulation. A bank's privately optimal encumbrance choice balances the benefit of expanding profitable yet illiquid investment, funded by cheap long-term senior secured debt, against the cost of greater fragility from runs on unsecured debt. We derive testable implications about encumbrance ratios. The introduction of deposit insurance or wholesale funding guarantees induces excessive encumbrance and fragility. Ex-ante limits on asset encumbrance or ex-post Pigovian taxes eliminate such risk-shifting incentives. Our results shed light on prudential policies currently pursued in several jurisdictions.},

abstract = {Since the global financial crisis, two significant regulatory initiatives have been introduced in the form of the central clearing mandate and bilateral margin requirements. A major implication of these initiatives is the need for major players in the OTC derivative market to post collateral, in the form of initial margin, against their transactions. In this paper, we discuss some of the problems associated with initial posting, such as the quantification of the residual counterparty risk and associated capital requirements. We also characterise a wealth transfer mechanism when parties post initial margin which causes OTC derivative creditors to become more senior at the expense of other creditors. Initial margin has clear funding implications in the form of margin value adjustment (MVA) and the pricing of the underlying wealth transfer effect in unsecured lending transactions.},

These techniques work with probabilistic domain-specific data modeling languages that capture key properties of a broad class of data generating processes, using Bayesian inference to synthesize probabilistic programs in these modeling languages given observed data. We provide a precise formulation of Bayesian synthesis for automatic data modeling that identifies sufficient conditions for the resulting synthesis procedure to be sound. We also derive a general class of synthesis algorithms for domain-specific languages specified by probabilistic context-free grammars and establish the soundness of our approach for these languages. We apply the techniques to automatically synthesize probabilistic programs for time series data and multivariate tabular data. We show how to analyze the structure of the synthesized programs to compute, for key qualitative properties of interest, the probability that the underlying data generating process exhibits each of these properties. Second, we translate probabilistic programs in the domain-specific language into probabilistic programs in Venture, a general-purpose probabilistic programming system. The translated Venture programs are then executed to obtain predictions of new time series data and new multivariate data records. Experimental results show that our techniques can accurately infer qualitative structure in multiple real-world data sets and outperform standard data analysis methods in forecasting and predicting new data.},

We find that a firm's leverage is lower when a larger proportion of its revenue is derived from CDS-referenced customers. This finding is robust to alternative samples and measures, placebo tests, and the selection of customers by suppliers. Moreover, firms affected by customer CDS trading issue equity to lower leverage, and their equity issuance costs are lower. These findings are consistent with the view that CDS trading on customers improves the information environment for suppliers. Therefore, while many firms are not directly linked to CDS trading, CDS trading on their customers has spillover effects on these firms' financial policies.},

abstract = {We evaluate three ECB policies involving government bond purchases, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), and the 3-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) using an event-study approach. Focusing on Italy, Spain and Portugal, we find that the policies reduced sovereign bond yields dramatically. We decompose the policy impact on sovereign yields into effects via default risk, market segmentation of sovereign bonds and redenomination risk. We find that: (a) Default risk and sovereign bond segmentation effects were the dominant channels through which the SMP and the OMT affected sovereign bond yields of Italy and Spain; (b) Redenomination risk may have been present at times and it may have been a third policy channel for the SMP and OMT in the case of Spain and Portugal, but not for Italy. (c) The effects of the LTROs on sovereign yields were generally small except for Spain for which they appear to have reduced sovereign bond yields via the market segmentation channel. We reach these conclusions by examining the dynamics of a collection of asset prices, including euro-denominated sovereign bond yields, dollar- denominated sovereign bond yields, corporate bond yields, and corporate credit default swap rates. ECB policies aimed at reducing government bond yields also had beneficial macroeconomic spillovers. We show this by documenting large increases in stock prices in both distressed and core countries.},

In addition, seller shocks possess information for spreads that is independent of institution-wide measures of constraints.

We find that the high concentration of Greek equity portfolios imposes a substantial return and utility loss which is further increased when the lack of international diversification is taken into account.

abstract = {This paper analyses investment strategies of three types of Dutch institutional investors - pension funds, life insurers and non-life insurers - over the period 1999-2005. We use balance sheet and cash flow data, including purchases and sales of equity, fixed income and real estate. We trace asset reallocations back to both active trading and revaluations and link investment decisions to firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic variables. Overall, our results indicate that all three investor types tend to be contrarian traders, i.e. they buy past losers and sell past winners. Especially pension funds showed this behaviour in the most turbulent part of the sample - the crash of 2002 and early 2003 - implying that these institutions have a stabilising impact on financial markets when this is needed most. Life insurers tend to be contrarian traders when they have a high proportion of unit-linked policies, while non-life insurers are contrarian when they have a more risky business model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the determinants of public pension fund investment risk and reports several new important findings. Unlike private pension plans, public funds undertake more risk if they are underfunded and have lower investment returns in the previous years, consistent with the risk transfer hypothesis. Furthermore, pension funds in states facing fiscal constraints allocate more assets to equity and have higher betas. There also appears to be a herding effect in that CalPERS equity allocation or beta is mimicked by other pension funds. Finally, our results suggest that government accounting standards strongly affect pension fund risk, as higher return assumptions (used to discount pension liabilities) are associated with higher equity allocation and portfolio beta. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a sample of shareholder proposals from 1993 to 2013 and a hand-collected data set of the political variables of public pension funds, we document evidence consistent with the "political attention hypothesis." We find that the number of politicians on public pension fund boards is significantly positively related to the frequency with which portfolio firms are targeted. Moreover, the frequency of social-responsibility proposals by public pension funds increases significantly, as the funds have a greater number of board members running for election to public office. However the frequency of corporate governance proposals is not related to the number of board members running for elections to public office. Furthermore, we document that political connection between a portfolio firm and a public pension fund mitigates the firm's likelihood of being targeted by the fund with social-responsibility proposals. This result supports the "political contribution hypothesis." The paper provides direct evidence that public pension-fund board members employ shareholder proposals to enhance their political capital.},

Using two structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models and a counterfactual scenario analysis, the results show that monetary policy shocks, as identified by changes in Treasury yields following changes in the central bank's target interest rates, lead to a substantial increase in pension funds' allocation to equity assets. Notably, the shift from bonds to equity securities is greater during the period where the US Federal Reserve launched unconventional monetary policy measures. Additional findings show a positive correlation between pension fund risk-taking, low interest rates and the decline in Treasury yields across both well-funded and underfunded public pension plans, which is thus consistent with a structural risk-shifting incentive.},

We use a unique database covering the asset allocations of US defined-benefit pension funds for the period 1990-2008, and we test the role of each factor in explaining their returns. Our results shed new light on pension funds' sources of performance. While the previous literature emphasized that policy allocation accounts for the bulk of returns, leaving little room for active management, we show that taking explicit account of market movement can change the results significantly. Although active management plays a minor role in global asset allocation, its role is predominant in explaining returns to individual asset classes, whether traditional or alternative.

abstract = {This paper offers a theory by which dealer banks obtain funding liquidity by serving as intermediaries between hedge funds and cash investors  in the markets for repurchase (repo) agreements. The model explains how the demand by dealer banks for funding liquidity determines repo haircuts and repo pricing. A dealer bank obtains liquidity to the extent of the spread between the haircut on its repos with cash investors and the haircut on its reverse repos with hedge funds. Dealer banks optimally choose the extent to which they use this funding mechanism over alternatives such as cash holdings and fire sales of illiquid assets. Rehypothecation and over-collateralization might expose hedge funds to the bankruptcy risk of dealer banks. The model pins down repo haircuts and interest rates jointly. Haircut spreads are low and hedge funds are not exposed to the bankruptcy risk of dealers when liquidity is abundant. When liquidity is relatively scarce, haircut spreads are high and hedge funds are exposed to the bankruptcy risk of dealers. The model highlights the volume of lending by cash investors and dealer balance sheets as key determinants of haircut spreads. The predictions of the model are consistent with the data.},

Regulations restricting the practice are shown to have very different consequences depending on how they are designed. Assigning collateral to segregated accounts, as prescribed in the Dodd–Frank Act, is generally welfare-reducing. In contrast, an SEC15c3-3 type regulation can improve welfare through the regulatory premium it confers on cash holdings, which are inefficiently low when interest rates and inflation are high.},

Finally, endogenous credit intermediation arises whereby trusty counterparties re-use collateral and borrow on behalf of riskier counterparties.

In this framework, we show that total collateral volume and its velocity are affected by characteristics of the network like the length of rehypothecation chains, the presence or not of chains having a cyclic structure, the direction of collateral flows, the density of the network. In addition, we show that structures where collateral flows are concentrated among few nodes (like in core-periphery networks) allow large increases in collateral volumes already with small network density. Furthermore, we introduce in the model collateral hoarding rates determined according to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) criterion, and we then study the emergence of collateral hoarding cascades in different networks. Our results highlight that network structures with highly concentrated collateral flows are also more exposed to large collateral hoarding cascades following local shocks.

Moreover, the spillover effects of fire sales, haircut prociclicality and liquidity hoarding are specifically considered through indirect transmission channels. This framework allows us to analyze the determinants of systemic crisis and the resilience of different financial network configurations. Our first experiment demonstrates the benefits of counterparty diversification as a way of reducing systemic risk. The second experiment highlights the positive effect of higher initial capital and liquidity levels, while stressing the potentially counterproductive impact of rapidly increasing the minimum capital and liquidity ratios. The third experiment examines the possibility of controlling the maximum haircut rates, although the impact of this measure is modest compared to other alternatives. Finally, our last experiment evidences the fundamental role played by fire sales and market liquidity in either leading or mitigating systemic crises.},

We present a model which embeds longitudinal network data as trajectories in a latent Euclidean space. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters and latent positions of the actors in the network. The model yields meaningful visualization of dynamic networks, giving the researcher insight into the evolution and the structure, both local and global, of the network. The model handles directed or undirected edges, easily handles missing edges, and lends itself well to predicting future edges. Further, a novel approach is given to detect and visualize an attracting influence between actors using only the edge information. We use the case-control likelihood approximation to speed up the estimation algorithm, modifying it slightly to account for missing data.

abstract = {Through the lens of market participants' objective to minimize counterparty risk exposure, we provide an explanation for the reluctance to clear derivative trades in the absence of a central clearing obligation. We develop a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and potential pitfalls with respect to a single market participant's counterparty risk exposure when moving from a bilateral to a clearing architecture for derivative markets. Previous studies suggest that central clearing is beneficial for single market participants in the presence of a sufficiently large number of clearing members. We show that three elements can render central clearing harmful for a market partic-ipant's counterparty risk exposure regardless of the number of its counterparties: 1) correlation across and within derivative classes (i.e., systematic risk), 2) collateralization of derivative claims, and 3) loss sharing among clearing members. Our results have substantial implications for the design of derivatives markets, and highlight that recent central clearing reforms might not incentivize market participants to clear derivatives.},

For broker-dealers, vulnerabilities in the repo market are driven by flight-to-quality episodes, when liquidity and leverage can change rapidly. We estimate that an exogenous 1 percent decline in the price of all assets financed with repos leads to losses due to fire sale spillovers of 8 percent of total broker-dealer equity on average and over 12 percent during the financial crisis. For bank holding companies, vulnerabilities to fire-sales are equally sizable but build up slowly over time. Our measure signals build-up of systemic risk starting in the early 2000s, ahead of many other measures. Our measure also predicts low quantiles of macroeconomic outcomes above and beyond other existing measures, especially at longer horizons.},

Therefore, primary dealers have the incentive to increase liquidity due to competition for issuance fees. We find that the expected issuance fee is significantly related to market liquidity. Issuance fee driven liquidity is especially strong for countries with high funding needs, in periods of high uncertainty, and for bonds with low risk. },

@article{Calomiris2014,
abstract = {We examine changes in banks' market-to-book ratios over the last decade, focusing on the dramatic and persistent declines witnessed during the financial crisis. The extent of the decline and its persistence cannot be explained by the delayed recognition of losses on existing financial instruments. Rather, it is declines in the values of intangibles - including customer relationships and other intangibles related to business opportunities - along with unrecognized contingent obligations that account for most of the persistent decline in market-to-book ratios. These shifts reflect a combination of changed economic circumstances (e.g., low interest rates reduce the value of core deposits; meager growth opportunities reduce the value of customer relationships) and changed regulatory policies. Together, these changes in the business environment since the financial crisis have led investors to associate little value with intangibles. For example, changing market perceptions of the consequences of leverage have affected the way investors value banks; prior to the crisis, higher leverage, ceteris paribus, was associated with greater value (reflecting the high relative cost of equity finance), but during and after the crisis, as default risk and regulatory concerns came to the fore, lower leverage was associated with greater value. Reflecting the rising importance of regulatory risks (e.g., the uncertain consequences of the Volcker Rule), after controlling for other influences, dividend payments (a signal of management and regulatory perceptions of the persistence of financial strength) matter for market prices much more after the crisis, while increases in recurring fee income matter less. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In our paper we observe that reaching a high level of quality for integrated data is more challenging than for individual source data sets. Indeed, the quality of integrated data is also associated to the level of maturity of different dimensions of data management. As a consequence, individual source data sets, even if already fitted for a certain purpose, should be also "prepared for integration" with the help of integrated data management policies and best practices.

abstract = {Global banks use their global balance sheets to respond to local monetary policy. However, sources and uses of funds are often not denominated in the same currency. This leads to an FX exposure that banks need to hedge. If cross-currency flows are large, the hedging cost increases diminishing the return on lending in foreign currency. We show that, in response to domestic monetary policy easing, global banks increase their foreign reserves in currency areas with the highest rate, while decreasing lending in these markets. We also find an increase in FX hedging activity and its rising cost, as manifested in violations of covered interest rate parity.},

abstract = {This paper documents the evolution of international financial integration since the global financial crisis using an updated dataset on external assets and liabilities, covering over 210 economies for the period 1970-2015. It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-{\`{a}}-vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.},

We find that changes in macroprudential policy via loan-to-value limits and local-currency reserve requirements have a significant impact on international bank lending. Balance sheet characteristics play an important role in determining the strength of these effects, with better-capitalized banking systems and those with more liquid assets and less core deposit funding reacting more.

abstract = {This paper explores the basic question of whose monetary policy matters for banks' international lending. In the international context, monetary policies from several countries could come into play: the lender's, the borrower's, and that of a third country, the issuer of the currency in which cross-border lending is denominated. Using the rich dimensionality of the BIS international banking statistics, we find significant effects for all three policies. US monetary easing fuels cross-border lending in US dollars, as befits a global funding currency. At the same time, a tightening in the lender or the borrower country reinforces international dollar lending as global banks turn to the greenback for cheaper funding and toward borrowers abroad. Our results also show that stronger capitalization and better access to funding sources mitigate the frictions underpinning the transmission channels. Analogous results for euro-denominated lending confirm that global funding currencies play a key role in international monetary policy transmission.},

abstract = {Credit default swaps can be used to lower the capital requirements of dealer banks entering into uncollateralized derivatives positions with sovereigns. We show in a model that the regulatory incentive to obtain capital relief makes CDS contracts valuable to dealer banks and empirically that, consistent with the use of CDS for regulatory purposes, there is a disconnect between changes in bond yield spreads and in CDS premiums, especially for safe sovereigns. Additional empirical tests related to the volume of contracts outstanding, effects of regulatory proxies, and the corporate bond and CDS markets support that CDS contracts are used for capital relief. We argue in this paper that the level of sovereign CDS premiums and the notional amounts outstanding are significantly influenced by financial regulation. We focus mainly on sovereign CDS markets because the regulatory setting here is particularly well suited for our purpose. Derivatives-dealing banks engage in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, with sovereigns. Most sovereigns do not post collateral in these transactions and this leaves the dealer banks exposed to counterparty-credit risk. We explain how this risk—through a so-called " credit value adjustment (CVA) " —adds to the dealer banks' risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and hence to their capital requirements.

Nonfinancial firms choose low leverage to protect their banks, presenting a partial resolution to the low-leverage puzzle. Our setup naturally extends to include government actions as we model bank assets using a modified Basel framework. Deposit insurance and bailout expectations lead banks and borrowers to take on more risk. Capital regulation lowers bank leverage but can increase bank risk due to a compensating increase in borrower leverage. Despite this, doubling current capital requirements reduces bank default risk by up to 90{\%}, with only a small increase in loan interest rates.},

To improve financial stability, regulators have proposed limiting banks' size and interconnectedness.

Trading efficiency decreases with limits on interconnectedness because the intermediation chains become longer. While restricting the interconnectedness of banks improves stability, the effect is non-monotonic. Stability also improves with higher liquidity requirements, when banks have access to liquidity during the crisis, and when failed banks' depositors maintain confidence in the banking system.},

Variables that should in theory determine credit spread changes have rather limited explanatory power. Further, the residuals from this regression are highly cross-correlated, and principal components analysis implies they are mostly driven by a single common factor. Although we consider several macroeconomic and financial variables as candidate proxies, we cannot explain this common systematic component. Our results suggest that monthly credit spread changes are principally driven by local supply/demand shocks that are independent of both credit-risk factors and standard proxies for liquidity.},

abstract = {Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk, the risk that a substantial fraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Systemic risk can propagate through different mechanisms and channels of contagion. One important form of financial contagion arises from indirect interconnections between financial institutions mediated by financial markets. This indirect interconnection occurs when financial institutions invest in common assets and is referred to as overlapping portfolios. In this work we quantify systemic risk from indirect interconnections between financial institutions. Having complete information of security holdings of major Mexican financial intermediaries and the ability to uniquely identify securities in their portfolios, allows us to represent the Mexican financial system as a bipartite network of securities and financial institutions. This makes it possible to quantify systemic risk arising from overlapping portfolios. We show that focusing only on direct exposures underestimates total systemic risk levels by up to 50{\%}. By representing the financial system as a multi-layer network of direct exposures (default contagion) and indirect exposures (overlapping portfolios) we estimate the mutual influence of different channels of contagion. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that includes overlapping portfolios.},

When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, a natural way to return to target leverage is to sell assets. If potential buyers are limited, then asset sales depress prices, in which case one bank[U+05F3]s sales impact other banks with common exposures. We show how this contagion effect adds up across the banking sector, and how it can be estimated empirically using balance sheet data. We compute bank exposures to system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillovers induced by individual banks. Applying the model to European banks, we evaluate a variety of interventions to reduce their vulnerability to fire sales during the sovereign debt crisis.},

Overall, we observe a complex relationship between the derivatives market and the underlying cash market characterised by sizable deviations from the no-arbitrage relationship (i.e. basis equal to zero). We show that short-selling frictions explain the persistence of positive basis deviations while funding frictions explain the persistence of negative basis deviations which are observed for countries with weak public finances. Moreover, we show that the "flight-to-quality/liquidity" phenomenon in bond markets is a key driver of the large positive basis of better rated countries.},

abstract = {Common asset holdings are widely believed to have been the primary vector of contagion in the recent financial crisis. We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify instabilities. The financial system exhibits "robust yet fragile" behavior, with regions of the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews some work on bounded rationality, expectation formation and learning in complex markets, using the familiar demand-supply cobweb model. We emphasize two stories of bounded rationality, one story of adaptive learning and another story of evolutionary selection. According to the adaptive learning story agents are identical, and can be represented by an "average agent", who adapts his behavior trying to learn an optimal rule within a class of simple (e.g. linear) rules. The second story is concerned with heterogeneous, interacting agents and evolutionary selection of different forecasting rules. Agents can choose between costly sophisticated forecasting strategies, such as rational expectations, and freely available simple strategies, such as naive expectations, based upon their past performance. We also confront both stories to laboratory experiments on expectation formation. At the end of the chapter, we integrate both stories and consider an economy with evolutionary selection between a costly sophisticated adaptive learning rule and a cheap simple forecasting rule such as naive expectations.},

abstract = {Counterparty risk measurement integrates two sources of risk: market risk, which determines the size of a firm's exposure to a counter party, and credit risk, which reflects the likelihood that the counterparty will default on its obligations. Wrong-way risk refers to the possibility that a counterparty's default risk increases with the market value of the exposure. We investigate the potential impact of wrong-way risk in calculating a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to a derivatives portfolio: CVA has become a standard tool for pricing counterparty risk and setting associated capital requirements. We present a method, introduced in our earlier work, for bounding the impact of wrong-way risk on CVA. The method holds fixed marginal models for market and credit risk while varying the dependence between them. Given simulated paths of the two models, we solve a linear program to find the worst-case CVA resulting from wrong way risk. The worst case can be overly conservative, so we extend the procedure by penalizing deviations of the joint model from a baseline model. By varying the penalty for deviations, we can sweep out the full range of possible CVA values for different degrees of wrong-way risk. Our method addresses an important source of model risk in counterparty risk measurement. },

Unsecured borrowing constraints generate a constrained-arbitrage relation between the repo rate, the (adjusted) expected rate of return of the underlying security, and the unsecured rate. Collateral spreads can turn negative if borrowing constraints tighten, unsecured rates spike down, or from depressed and illiquid securities markets. Collateral spreads increase in haircuts and decrease in the volatility, illiquidity, and expected rate of return of the underlying collateral. Empirical tests using comprehensive data from Eurex Repo are supportive. We use the theory to provide a narrative of the evolution of collateral spreads from before to after the financial crisis.},

abstract = {Using new regulatory data, this paper contributes to the growing literature on derivatives markets and (systemic) risk, by providing a first account of the Dutch CDS market, investigating the factors that drive buying and selling of credit protection ('flow-of risk'), and analysing the impact of Brexit. We find that the CDS market has a 'core-periphery' structure in which Dutch banks are CDS sellers while insurance firms and pension funds (ICPF's) and 'other financial institutions' (OFIs) are buyers. When the volatility of a reference entity increases, the propensity to sell CDS decreases for banks and increases for ICPFs and OFIs. This hints at procyclical behaviour by banks and countercyclical behaviour by ICPFs and OFIs. The 'core-periphery' structure of the CDS market became more pronounced around Brexit events, making the CDS market more vulnerable to shocks emanating from 'systemic' players. Banks reduced net buying and selling of CDS protection on UK reference entities, while OFIs and investment funds became more dominant. This underpins the importance of adequate buyers for systemic institutions and extending the regulatory perimeter beyond banking.},

These firms substitute bank term loans with bond debt, thereby relaxing banks' lending constraints: banks with low Tier-1 ratios and high non-performing loans increase lending to private (and profitable) firms, which experience a growth in capital expenditures and sales. The credit reallocation increases banks' risk-taking in corporate credit. },

When bank loan returns have a common systematic factor, the cost of borrowing for a bank increases when there is adverse news on other banks since such news conveys adverse information about the common factor. The increase in a bank's cost of bor rowing relative to the situation of good news about other banks is greater when bank loan returns have less commonality (in addition to the systematic risk factor). Hence, banks herd and undertake correlated investments so as to minimize the impact of such information contagion on the expected cost of borrowing. Competitive effects such as superior margins from lending in different industries mitigate herding incentives. In this paper, we show that the likelihood of information contagion can induce even profit-maximizing bank owners to herd with other banks. Banks have an incentive to herd so as to minimize the information spillover from bad news about other banks on their borrowing costs and in turn on their future profits.},

We argue that an “overhang” of impaired banks that may be forced to sell assets soon can reduce the current price of illiquid assets sufficiently that weak banks have no interest in selling them. Anticipating a potential future fire sale, cash rich buyers have high expected returns to holding cash, which also reduces their incentive to lock up money in term loans. The potential for a worse fire sale than necessary, as well as the associated decline in credit origination, could make the crisis worse, which is one reason it may make sense to clean up the system even in the midst of the crisis.

Although rehypothecation benefits the end user through cost reduction of derivative trades, it also creates additional counterparty credit risk since the end user may not receive the collateral back when the dealer suddenly defaults. To evaluate the benefits and risks of rehypothecation, we propose a derivative pricing framework with bilateral counterparty credit risk that determines the amount of rehypothecable collateral. We also model the realistic features of derivative trades: two different types of collateral, the time delay of collateral posting and the rating-dependent collateral agreement. We apply our pricing framework to cross currency swaps and investigate the impact of rehypothecation on the swap spreads.},

The probability of systemic default is determined using a passage-problem approach in a network context and banks are able to internalize the network externalities of contagion through their holdings. Banks do not internalize the social costs to the real economy of a systemic default of the banking system. We investigate the optimal diversification strategy of banks in the face of opposite and persistent economic trends that are ex-ante unknown to banks. We find that the optimal level of risk diversification may be interior or extremal depending on banks exposure the external assets and that a tension arises whereby individual incentives favor a banking system that is over-diversified with respect to the level of diversification that is desirable in the social optimum.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to inform about a feature of monetary policy that is largely overlooked, yet occupies a central role in modern monetary and financial systems, namely central bank collateral frameworks. Their importance can be understood by the observation that the money at the core of these systems, central bank money, is injected into the economy on terms, not defined in a market, but by the collateral frameworks and interest rate policies of central banks. Using the collateral framework of the Eurosystem as a basis of illustration and case study, the paper brings to light the functioning, reach, and impact of collateral frameworks. A theme that emerges is that collateral frameworks may have distortive effects on financial markets and the wider economy. They can, for example, bias the private provision of real liquidity and thereby also the allocation of resources in the economy as well as contribute to financial instability. Evidence is presented that the collateral framework in the euro area promotes risky and illiquid collateral and, more generally, impairs market forces and discipline. The paper also emphasizes the important role of ratings and government guarantees in the Eurosystem's collateral framework.},

In this paper, we ask whether this facility has kept the intraday interest rate at zero. Using a unique transaction-level data set on collateralized interbank loans for 2006-12, we find that during periods of financial distress, rates for morning transactions are higher than those in the afternoon. Moreover, this intraday rate correlates with market liquidity, suggesting that rates contain a liquidity premium. This intraday pattern is reduced, but not eliminated by the Eurosystem's accommodative liquidity provision.},

The empirical results suggest that the ECB announcements about unconventional monetary policies substantially reduced long-term government bond yield spreads relative to German counterparts in all countries, except Greece. Particularly, among the different types of measures, news about the Securities Markets Programme strongly affected the perceived sovereign risk of the five stressed euro area countries, while the announcements of the Outright Monetary Transactions seem to have a significant impact only in Italy and Spain.},

In the German savings bank sector, distress events can be resolved by local politicians or a state-level association. We show that decisions by local politi-cians with close links to the bank are distorted by personal considerations: while distress events per se are not related to the electoral cycle, the probability of local politicians injecting tax-payers' money into a bank in distress is 30{\%} lower in the year directly preceding an election. Using the timing of the distress event in the electoral cycle as an instrument, we show that a decentralized local bailout results in worse future performance and less efficient credit allocation of the affected banks. We also observe a significantly worse real sector performance of locali-ties under decentralized political bailouts as compared with those under centralized association bailouts. Our findings illustrate that larger distance between banks and decision makers reduces distortions in the decision making process and has implications for the design of regulatory architecture.},

In contrast, insurance companies and pension funds act countercyclically; they buy when returns have been negative and sell after high returns.

To do so, we exploit the introduction of the LCR in Switzerland as a unique quasi-natural experiment and we find evidence for the existence of an HQLA premium in the order of 4 basis points. Guided by theoretical considerations, we claim that the HQLA premium is state dependent and argue that our estimate is a lower bound measure.

Consistent with central clearing reducing counterparty risk, CDS spreads increase around the commencement of central clearing and are lower than settlement spreads published by the central clearinghouse. Furthermore, the relation between CDS spreads and dealer credit risk weakens after central clearing begins, suggesting a lowering of systemic risk. These findings are robust to controls for frictions in both CDS and bond markets. Finally, matched sample analysis reveals that the increased post-trade transparency following central clearing is associated with an improvement in liquidity and trading activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Among the reforms to OTC derivative markets since the global financial crisis is a commitment to collateralize counterparty exposures and to clear standardized contracts via central counterparties (CCPs). The reforms aim to reduce interconnectedness and improve counterparty risk management in these important markets. At the same time, however, the reforms necessarily concentrate risk in one or a few nodes in the financial network and also increase institutions' demand for high-quality assets to meet collateral requirements. This paper looks more closely at the implications of increased CCP clearing for both the topology and stability of the financial network. Building on Heath et al. (2013) and Markose (2012), the analysis supports the view that the concentration of risk in CCPs could generate instability if not appropriately managed. Nevertheless, maintaining CCP prefunded financial resources in accordance with international standards and dispersing any unfunded losses widely through the system can limit the potential for a CCP to transmit stress even in very extreme market conditions. The analysis uses the Bank for International Settlements Macroeconomic Assessment Group on Derivatives (MAGD) data set on the derivatives positions of the 41 largest bank participants in global OTC derivative markets in 2012.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between banks' divergent strategies toward specialization and diversification of financial activities and their ability to withstand a banking sector crash. We first generate market-based measures of banks' systemic risk exposures using extreme value analysis. Systemic banking risk is measured as the tail beta, which equals the probability of a sharp decline in a bank's stock price conditional on a crash in a banking index. Subsequently, the impact of (the correlation between) interest income and the components of non-interest income on this risk measure is assessed. The heterogeneity in extreme bank risk is attributed to differences in the scope of non-traditional banking activities: non-interest generating activities increase banks' tail beta. In addition, smaller banks and better-capitalized banks are better able to withstand extremely adverse conditions. These relationships are stronger during turbulent times compared to normal economic conditions. Overall, diversifying financial activities under one umbrella institution does not improve banking system stability, which may explain why financial conglomerates trade at a discount.},

Empirically, we show quantitatively how bank characteristics are related to bank tail risk and systemic linkage. The interrelationship between bank characteristics and these dimensions deter-mine the relation between bank characteristics and systemic risk. Certain characteristics that are irrelevant to the soundness of a financial institution taken in isolation turn out to be important for the level of systemic risk, and vice versa.

abstract = {DT n° 2012-36, December 2012 This paper evaluates the impact of all ECB unconventional monetary policies implemented between 2007 and 2012 on bank and government borrowing costs. We employ event-based regressions to measure the effect of each policy. The borrowing conditions for banks are represented by money market spreads and covered bond spreads while the sovereign bond spreads reflect government borrowing costs. The results show that sovereign bond purchasing programs (SMP, OMT) proved to be the most effective in lowering longer-term borrowing costs for both banks and governments with the largest impact in periphery euroarea countries. The strong impact in the euro-area periphery suggests that the central bank intervention in sovereign market is particularly effective when the sovereign risk is important. Furthermore, both covered bond purchase programs and 3-year loans to banks reduced bank refinancing costs.},

In contrast, making use of the exact timing of interventions and movements in high-frequency inter-dealer quotes, we find clear evidence that SMP stabilised yields on average from the moment of the initial intervention until the end of trading on intervention days.

@article{Altavilla2015,
abstract = {We evaluate the effects on asset prices of the ECB asset purchase programme (APP) announced in January 2015 and assess its main transmission channels. We do so by first extending a term structure model with bond supply effects to account for assets with different types of risk premia. We then derive model-based predictions for cross-asset price movements associated with the transmission channels identified in the model. We finally validate empirically these predictions by means of an event-study methodology, reaching the following conclusions. The impact of the APP on asset prices is sizeable albeit the programme was announced at a time of low financial distress. This may appear puzzling in light of existing literature that finds a large impact of asset purchases only in periods of high financial distress. Consistent with the model, we explain this apparent puzzle by showing how the low financial distress, while indeed weakening certain transmission channels, has reinforced other channels because of its interplay with the asset composition of the programme. Targeting assets at long maturity and spanning the investment-grade space have supported the duration and the credit channels. At the same time, the low degree of financial stress prevailing at announcement of the programme, while weakening the local supply channel, has facilitated spill-overs to non-targeted assets.},

abstract = {Large-scale asset programmes aim to impact the real economy through the financial system. The ECB has focused much of its policies on safe assets. An intended channel of transmission of this type of programme is the " portfolio rebalancing channel " , whereby investors are influenced to shift their investments away from such safe assets towards assets with higher expected returns, including lending to households and firms. We examine the portfolio rebalancing channel around the ECB's asset purchase program (APP). We exploit cross-sectional heterogeneity in the impact of APP on the valuation of the financial portfolio held by different sectors of the European economy. Overall, our results provide evidence of an active portfolio rebalancing channel. In more vulnerable countries, where macroeconomic unbalances and relatively high risk premia remain, APP was mostly reflected into a rebalancing towards riskier securities. In less vulnerable countries, where constraints on loan demand and supply are less significant, the rebalancing was observed mostly in terms of bank loans. Examining large European banks, we confirm similar geographical differences.},

We investigate three possible types of supply shocks: related to the cumulative past purchases (" stock ") since the start of the program, the transactions themselves on the day of the purchase (" flow "), and the variation in the expected total size of the program (" expected stock "). Our results show that having purchased 10{\%} of a bond outstanding correlates with a decrease in yield of about -13 bps to -26 bps on average in the first year of implementation of the program, with bigger effects in the most illiquid segments. Set aside very particular conditions, we don't find any significant supplemental effect from flows, presumably in line with the market neutrality objective of the Eurosystem. We then focus on the European bond sell-off period during the spring-summer 2015, and show it was associated with a reduction of the total size of the program expected by market participants, suggesting an Odyssean vs Delphic type of issue for the communication on asset purchases.},

If anything, the market appears to have become more liquid in recent years. They also document that there is little evidence that liquidity is having a larger effect on bond spreads now than a few years ago. They do not find evidence that liquidity has become more "flighty" in response to shocks of a mildtomoderate nature, as measures of liquidity risk do not increase over the period of analysis. However, they do not claim that there are no risks associated with liquidity. Their own analysis shows that liquidity is subject to considerable deterioration if the market is under severe stress; there was considerably less liquidity in 2009-2010 than either before or after this period.},

@book{Lelyveld2009a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010. Introduction Assessment of the stability of the financial sector is well established in the Netherlands. Spurred by the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2004 and by increased attention for financial stability, as witnessed by the creation of a separate financial stability division at the central bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, DNB), many issues have been studied. An example is the analysis conducted and reported in the bi-annual Overview of Financial Stability in the Netherlands, highlighting inter alia operational problems in payment systems and the effect of (failing) credit risk transfer on the soundness of financial firms. Sometimes such analyses come eerily close to reality, as was the case with the securitisation scenario computed in mid-2007 (DNB, 2008). In this scenario banks were asked to compute the cost of taking their most recent securitisation back on the book. Liquidity effects found in this scenario were limited because of the short time horizon considered. In reality, in the late summer of 2007, the vulnerability of banks with the so-called originate-to-distribute model, in which banks securitise issued loans and sell them to interested investors via special legal entities, emerged prominently. Rising sub-prime mortgage default rates and growing doubts about the nature and value of the assets of special legal entities led to widespread downgrading of structured credit products containing such loans. This in turn caused the market financing of these entities to evaporate, generating uncertainty about possible draw downs of credit lines at sponsor banks.},

Using a spatial autore-gressive model that allows for direct network interactions, we find strong spillovers from the financial network to lending rates and quantities. These spillovers are economically large, time-varying and can switch sign after major economic shocks. Moreover, we find that empirically network complexity and uncertainty rise after a large negative shock. Counterfactual experiments confirm the quantitative importance of spillovers and network structure on lending rates and quantities and can be used to isolate the effects arising from spillovers versus network structure evolution.},

abstract = {A large share of dollar-denominated lending is done by non-U.S. banks, particularly European banks. We present a model in which such banks cut dollar lending more than euro lending in response to a shock to their credit quality. Because these banks rely on wholesale dollar funding, while raising more of their euro funding through insured retail deposits, the shock leads to a greater withdrawal of dollar funding. Banks can borrow in euros and swap into dollars to make up for the dollar shortfall, but this may lead to violations of covered interest parity when there is limited capital to take the other side of the swap trade. In this case, synthetic dollar borrowing also becomes expensive, which causes cuts in dollar lending. We test the model in the context of the Eurozone sovereign crisis, which escalated in the second half of 2011 and re- sulted in U.S. money market funds sharply reducing their exposure to European banks in the year that followed. During this period dollar lending by Eurozone banks fell relative to their euro lending, and firms who were more reliant on Eurozone banks before the Eurozone crisis had a more difficult time borrowing.},

We then use the geographic coordinates of these banks' branches and of 14,100 businesses to analyze how the lending techniques of banks near firms are related to credit constraints at two contrasting points of the credit cycle. We find that while relationship lending is not associated with credit constraints during a credit boom, it alleviates such constraints during a downturn. This positive role of relationship lending is stronger for small and opaque firms and in regions with a more severe economic downturn. Moreover, relationship lending mitigates the impact of a downturn on firm growth and does not constitute evergreening of loans.},

abstract = {Many debt claims, such as bonds, are resaleable; others, such as repos, are not. There was a fivefold increase in repo borrowing before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Why? Did banks' dependence on non-resaleable debt precipitate the crisis? In this paper, we develop a model of bank lending with credit frictions. The key feature of the model is that debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt. Such borrowing has a dark side: It causes credit chains to form, because, if a bank makes a loan via non-resaleable debt and needs liquidity, it cannot sell the loan but must borrow via a new contract. These credit chains are a source of systemic risk, as one bank's default harms not only its creditors but also its creditors' creditors. Overall, our model suggests that reducing credit market frictions may have an adverse effect on the financial system and even lead to the failures of financial institutions.},

As regards the determinants of sovereign bond holdings of banks, we find that these are larger for weakly capitalized banks, banks that are active on capital markets, and for large banks. Yet, only around two thirds of all German banks hold sovereign bonds. Macroeconomic fundamentals were significant drivers of sovereign bond holdings only after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. With the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis, German banks reallocated their portfolios toward sovereigns with lower debt ratios and bonds with lower yields. With regard to the implications for bank risk, we find that low-risk government bonds decreased the risk of German banks, especially for savings and cooperative banks. Holdings of high-risk government bonds, in turn, increased the risk of commercial banks during the sovereign debt crisis.},

We show that stable relationships exist and that they played a significant role during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Trading with preferred counterparts is associated with more favorable rates for both lenders and borrowers, and carries larger trading volumes. The results point to a peer monitoring role of relationship lending, which contributes, at a time of financial distress, to a smooth liquidity redistribution among banks. Relationship lending thus plays an important positive role for financial stability.},

The stability of the haircuts contrasts with evidence from the bilateral repo market, where, as shown by Gorton and Metrick (2011), haircuts increased sharply. During the crisis, adjustments in the volume of funding to dealers were not gradual; instead, the amount of funding in the tri-party repo market can decrease precipitously. Our findings suggest that runs in the tri-party repo market resemble traditional bank runs.},

We find some evidence pointing to financial institutions using the CDS market to take on additional risk, instead of hedging their pre-existing credit risk.

Issuer characteristics do not explain the results: holding fixed the issuer, funds with higher Eurozone exposure cut lending more. Due to credit market frictions, funds with low Eurozone exposure provided substitute financing only to issuers they had pre-existing relationships with, even though issuers are large, highly rated firms.},

abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.},

abstract = {A growing number of systems are represented as networks whose architecture conveys significant information and determines many of their properties. Examples of network architecture include modular, bipartite, and core-periphery structures. However inferring the network structure is a non trivial task and can depend sometimes on the chosen null model. Here we propose a method for classifying network structures and ranking its nodes in a statistically well-grounded fashion. The method is based on the use of Belief Propagation for learning through Entropy Maximization on both the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and the degree-corrected Stochastic Block Model (dcSBM). As a specific application we show how the combined use of the two ensembles -SBM and dcSBM- allows to disentangle the bipartite and the core-periphery structure in the case of the e-MID interbank network. Specifically we find that, taking into account the degree, this interbank network is better described by a bipartite structure, while using the SBM the core-periphery structure emerges only when data are aggregated for more than a week.},

abstract = {This paper analyses whether the post-crisis regulatory reforms developed by global-standard-setting bodies have created appropriate incentives for different types of market participants to centrally clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivative contracts. Beyond doc-umenting the observed facts, we analyse four main drivers for the decision to clear: 1) the liquidity and riskiness of the reference entity; 2) the credit risk of the counterparty; 3) the clearing member's portfolio net exposure with the Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) and 4) post trade transparency. We use confidential European trade repository data on single-name Sovereign Credit Derivative Swap (CDS) transactions, and show that for all the transactions reported in 2016 on Italian, German and French Sovereign CDS 48{\%} were centrally cleared, 42{\%} were not cleared despite being eligible for central clearing, while 9{\%} of the contracts were not clearable because they did not satisfy certain CCP clearing cri-teria. However, there is a large difference between CCP clearing members that clear about 53{\%} of their transactions and non-clearing members, even those that are subject to coun-terparty risk capital requirements, that almost never clear their trades. Moreover, we find that diverse factors explain clearing members' decision to clear different CDS contracts: for Italian CDS, counterparty credit risk exposures matter most for the decision to clear, while for French and German CDS, margin costs are the most important factor for the decision. Moreover, clearing members use clearing to reduce their exposures to the CCP and largely clear contracts when at least one of the traders has a high counterparty credit risk.},

abstract = {We study how intermediation and asset prices in over-the-counter markets are af-fected by illiquidity associated with search and bargaining. We compute explicitly the prices at which investors trade with each other, as well as marketmakers' bid and ask prices, in a dynamic model with strategic agents. Bid–ask spreads are lower if investors can more easily find other investors or have easier access to multiple marketmakers. With a monopolistic marketmaker, bid–ask spreads are higher if investors have eas-ier access to the marketmaker. We characterize endogenous search and welfare, and discuss empirical implications. IN OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS, an investor who wishes to sell must search for a buyer, incurring opportunity or other costs until one is found. Some over-the-counter (OTC) markets therefore have intermediaries. Contact with rele-vant intermediaries, however, is not immediate. Often, intermediaries must be approached sequentially. Hence, when two counterparties meet, their bilateral relationship is inherently strategic. Prices are set through a bargaining process that reflects each investor's or marketmaker's alternatives to immediate trade. These search-and-bargaining features are empirically relevant in many mar-kets, such as those for mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, emerging-market debt, bank loans, derivatives, and certain equity markets. In real-estate markets, for example, prices are influenced by imperfect search, the relative impatience of investors for liquidity, outside options for trade, and the role and profitability of brokers. We build a dynamic asset-pricing model that captures these features and analytically derive the equilibrium allocations, prices negotiated between in-vestors, as well as marketmakers' bid and ask prices. We show how these equilibrium properties depend on investors' search abilities, marketmaker ac-cessibility, and bargaining powers. We determine the search intensities that marketmakers choose, and derive the associated welfare implications of in-vestment in marketmaking. Our model of search is a variant of the coconuts model of Diamond (1982). 2},

SES increases with the institution's leverage and with its expected loss in the tail of the system's loss distribution. Institutions internalize their externality if they are “taxed” based on their SES. We demonstrate empirically the ability of SES to predict emerging risks during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, in particular, (i) the outcome of stress tests performed by regulators; (ii) the decline in equity valuations of large financial firms in the crisis; and, (iii) the widening of their credit default swap spreads},

Guided by theoretical considerations, we claim that the HQLA premium is state dependent and argue that our estimate is a lower bound measure. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of an economically significant HQLA premium. Thereby, we contribute to a better understanding of the LCR and its implications for financial markets.},

abstract = {We use the term structure of spreads between rates on interest rate swaps indexed to LIBOR and overnight indexed swaps to infer a term structure of interbank risk. We develop a dynamic term structure model with default risk in the interbank market that, in conjunction with information from the credit default swap market, allows us to decompose the term structure of interbank risk into default and non-default components. On average, from August 2007 to January 2011, the fraction of total interbank risk due to default risk increases with maturity. At the short end of the term structure, the non-default component is important in the first half of the sample and is corre- lated with various measures of market-wide liquidity. Further out the term structure, the default component is the dominant driver of interbank risk throughout the sample period. These results hold true in both the USD and EUR markets and are robust to different model parameterizations and measures of interbank default risk. The analysis has implications for monetary and regulatory policy as well as for pricing, hedging, and risk-management in the interest rate swap market.},

This early hormone difference exerts permanent influences on brain development and behavior. Contemporary research shows that hormones are particularly important for the development of sex-typical childhood behavior, including toy choices, which until recently were thought to result solely from sociocultural influences. Prenatal testosterone exposure also appears to influence sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as some, but not all, sex-related cognitive, motor and personality characteristics. Neural mechanisms responsible for these hormone-induced behavioral outcomes are beginning to be identified, and current evidence suggests involvement of the hypothalamus and amygdala, as well as interhemispheric connectivity, and cortical areas involved in visual processing.},

@article{Shorter2014,
abstract = {High-frequency trading (HFT) is a broad term without a precise legal or regulatory definition. It is used to describe what many characterize as a subset of algorithmic trading that involves very rapid placement of orders, in the realm of tiny fractions of a second. Regulators have been scrutinizing HFT practices for years, but public concern about this form of trading intensified following the April 2014 publication of a book by author Michael Lewis. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice (DOJ), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Office of the New York Attorney General, and the Massachusetts Secretary of Commerce have begun HFT-related probes. Critics of HFT have raised several concerns about its impact. One criticism relates to its generation of so-called phantom liquidity, in which market liquidity that appears to be provided by HFT may be fleeting and transient due to the posting of and then the almost immediate cancellation of trading orders. Another concern some have is that HFT firms may engage in manipulative strategies that involve the use of quote cancellations. In addition, some observers allege that HFT firms are often involved in front-running whereby the firms trade ahead of a large order to buy or sell stocks based on non-public market information about an imminent trade. Another criticism is that HFT has increased the level of potential market systemic risk whereby shocks to a small number of active HFT traders could then detrimentally affect the entire market. A related concern is whether HFT could exacerbate market volatility. These concerns have percolated since the “Flash Crash” of May 6, 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by roughly 1,000 points in intraday trading—the largest one-day decline in the history of the DJIA. The crash was analyzed in an investigative report by the SEC and CFTC which, among other factors, looked at the role that HFT may have played and determined that it was not the cause, but may have exacerbated the crash. Another area of criticism is that HFT often involves two-tiered markets, in which HFT firms pay extra for the right to access data feeds, or to collocate their servers within exchanges' servers—all of which is designed to give some traders an advantage over others. HFT's supporters argue that the increased trading provided by HFT adds market liquidity and reduces market volatility. They argue that HFT is a technological innovation that is the latest evolutionary stage in a long history of securities market making. They assert that HFT has reduced the bid-ask spreads in stock trading, thereby lowering trading costs. Congressional interest in HFT and the Flash Crash has manifested itself in the 113th Congress both legislatively and in the congressional oversight of the SEC and CFTC. Legislatively, S. 410 (Harkin), H.R. 880 (DeFazio), and H.R. 1579 (Ellison) would levy taxes on various financial trades, including trades conducted by HFT traders. H.R. 2292 (Markey) would require the CFTC to provide a regulatory definition of HFT in the derivatives markets it oversees and require those who do HFT to register with the CFTC. In June 2014, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White announced that in response to concerns over “aggressive, destabilizing trading strategies in vulnerable market conditions,” the agency was pursuing several HFT-related reform proposals, including requiring unregistered HFT firms to register with the agency. This report provides an overview of HFT in the equities and derivatives markets regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. It also examines the Flash Crash of 2010 and the role that HFT may have played, as well as recent regulatory developments.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of margining, a widely-used mechanism for attaching collateral to derivatives contracts, on derivatives trading volume, default risk, and on the welfare in the banking sector. First, we develop a stylized banking sector equilibrium model to develop some basic intuition of the effects of margining. We find that a margin requirement can be privately and socially sub-optimal. Subsequently, we extend this model into a dynamic simulation model that captures some of the essential characteristics of over-the-counter derivatives markets. Contrarily to the common belief that margining always reduces default risk, we find that there exist situations in which margining increases default risk, reduces aggregate derivatives' trading volume, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare in the banking sector. The negative effects of margining are exacerbated during periods of market stress when margin rates are high and collateral is scarce. We also find that central counterparties only lift some of the inefficiencies caused by margining. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In our book, Global Capital Markets: Integration, Crisis, and Growth, we traced out the evolution of the international monetary system using the framework of the " international monetary trilemma " : countries can enjoy at most two from the set {\{}exchange-rate stability, open capital markets, and domestic monetary autonomy{\}}. The events of the past decade or more highlight the further complications for this framework posed by financial stability issues. Here we update and qualify our prior analysis, drawing on recent experience and research. Under the classical gold standard, scant attention was paid to macro management, either to stabilize output and employment or to ensure financial stability. The interwar years highlighted the changing demands for modern central bank interventions in the economy. Financial instability, followed by WWII, left a world with sharply constricted financial markets and little private cross-border capital mobility. Due to this historical accident, the Bretton Woods system agreed in 1944 focused not at all on financial stability, and focused on issues like adjustment, exchange rate misalignment, and international liquidity (defined in terms of official, not private, capital-account transactions). Post 1970s floating rates permitted, but did not require, liberalization of the capital account. But the political equilibrium had shifted in favor of financial interests, signaled by the push toward European integration and the later reform process in emerging markets starting in the 1990s. This development, however, opened the door once again to domestic financial crises and their international transmission. Countries now become more susceptible to a new species of " capital account crises, " fueled by bank and bond lending, and its sudden withdrawal. These developments, in fact, made evident a different, " financial trilemma " : countries can pick at most two from {\{}financial stability, open capital markets, and autonomy over domestic financial policy{\}}. We distill the main lessons as to the interactions between the monetary and financial trilemmas, and policies that could best address the resulting weaknesses.},

In particular, banks that are small, weakly capitalised and with a higher share of wholesale funding react more strongly to changes in macroprudential tools. Third, controlling for bank-specific characteristics, macroprudential policies are more effective in a tightening than in an easing episode.},

CoCo issuance is primarily driven by their potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The bulk of the demand for CoCos has come from small investors, while institutional investors have been relatively restrained so far.

@article{Gregory2009,
abstract = {A recent trend in pricing counterparty credit risk for OTC derivatives has involved taking into account the bilateral nature of the risk so that an institution would reduce counterparty risk in line with their own default probability. Done to an extreme, this practice has worrying implications such as causing a derivatives portfolio with counterparty risk to be more valuable than the equivalent risk-free positions. In this paper, we argue that to apply na{\"{i}}ve bilateral pricing of counterparty risk is rather dangerous and we present a simple realistic approach for pricing and hedging counterparty risk in OTC derivatives accounting for default of both parties. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty in a financial contract will default prior to the expiration of the contract and fail to make future payments. Counterparty risk is taken by each party in an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contract and is present in all asset classes, including interest-rates, foreign-exchange, equity derivatives, commodities and credit derivatives. Given the recent decline in credit quality and heterogeneous concentration of credit exposure, together with high profiles defaults of Enron, Parmalat and Bear Stearns, the topic of counterparty risk management remains an important one. A typical financial institution, whilst making use of risk mitigants such as collateralisation and netting, will still take a significant amount of counterparty risk which needs to be priced and risk managed appropriately. Over the last decade, financial institutions have built up their capabilities for handling counterparty risk and active hedging has also become common, largely in the form of buying credit default swap (CDS) protection to mitigate large exposures (or future exposures). Most banks have a dedicated counterparty risk management unit which will charge a premium to each business line to bear the counterparty risk of a new trade, taking advantage of portfolio level risk mitigants such as netting and collateralisation. Such might operate partly on an actuarial basis, making use of the diversification benefits of the exposures, and partly on a risk-neutral basis hedging key risks such as default and FX volatility.},

Banks used the sovereign CDS market to extend, rather than hedge, their long exposures to government default risk during the crisis period: Less loan exposure to sovereign risk is associated with more protection selling in CDS, the effect being weaker when sovereign risk is high. Somewhat surprisingly, bank risk variables are not associated with protection selling. The findings are driven by the actions of a few non-dealer banks, which sold aggressively at the onset of the crisis and started covering their positions at its height. The results suggest that the increasing shift by bank loan books towards sovereign bonds and loans over the course of the crisis caused reductions to their sovereign CDS exposure.},

abstract = {Reconstructing patterns of interconnections from partial information is one of the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. A paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and amplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate balance sheets of these institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover, reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing bipartite networks of security holdings (e.g., investment portfolios). Here we propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization, tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the traditional capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and allows to reproduce the correct topology of the network. We test the method on a dataset, collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed MECAPM both in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk.},

Coupon payments are made at issuers' discretion while loss absorption can be triggered at regulators' discretion. This study investigates price effects of four press releases by Deutsche Bank AG in February 2016 related to the bank's willingness and ability to make its upcoming CoCo coupon payments. Expected cash flow models capture changes in CoCo default risk, while event dates capture uncertainty effects. The price of a European G-SIB peer group portfolio declined a statistically significant 2.0-2.5 percent over two days in response to Deutsche Bank's first press release. Deutsche Bank's efforts to allay its own CoCo investors' concerns appeared to increase concerns among CoCo investors generally. The results show potential negative effects of regulatory discretion.},

abstract = {We analyze the impact of CDS introduction on real decision-making within the firm, taking into ac- count differences in the local economic and legal environment of firms. We extend the model of Bolton and Oehmke (2011) in order to consider uncertainty in whether actions taken by the refer- ence entity will trigger CDS obligations. We test the predictions of the model in a sample of more than 56,000 firms across 50 countries over the period 2001-2015. We find substantial evidence that the introduction of CDS affects real decisions within the firm, including leverage, investment, and the risk of the investments taken by the firm. Importantly, we find that the legal and market envi- ronment in which the reference entity operates has an influence on the impact of CDS. The effect of CDS is larger where uncertainty regarding their obligations is reduced, and where they mitigate weak property rights. We also find that CDS are more likely to be introduced on firms that are headquar- tered in countries with weaker creditor rights, a stronger orientation toward bank financing, and lower levels of ownership concentration.

An important special case of our setup is the two-way regression model, which is a workhorse method in the analysis of matched data sets. Networks are typically quite sparse and it is difficult to see how the data carry information about certain parameters. We derive bounds on the variance of the fixed-effect estimator that uncover the importance of the structure of the network. These bounds depend on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the (normalized) Laplacian of the network and on the degree structure of the network. The Laplacian is a matrix that describes the network and its smallest non-zero eigenvalue is a measure of connectivity, with smaller values indicating less-connected networks. These bounds yield conditions for consistent estimation and convergence rates, and allow to evaluate the accuracy of first-order approximations to the variance of the fixed-effect estimator. The bounds are also used to assess the bias and variance of estimators of moments of the fixed effects},

Overall, turnover in both OTC and exchange-traded markets has expanded moderately since 2013. The average daily turnover of US dollar-denominated instruments has nearly doubled, driven by contracts with short maturities. Turnover of euro-denominated instruments has halved. We argue that monetary policy has been an important factor behind these changes. Despite a tightening of US monetary policy, activity in long-maturity US dollar contracts has remained subdued, which we attribute to reduced hedging demand from government-sponsored enterprises. Regulatory reforms have continued to influence market structure. To date, OTC markets have not lost market share to exchanges. In fact, regulatory changes are making OTC markets more similar to exchanges.},

Of particular concern to these observers are that credit default swaps trade in the largely unregulated over-the-counter market as bilateral contracts involving counterparty risk and that they facilitate speculation involving negative views of a firm's financial strength. Some observers have suggested that credit default swaps would not have made the crisis worse had they been traded on exchanges. I conclude that credit default swaps did not cause the dramatic events of the credit crisis, that the over-the-counter credit default swaps market worked well during much of the first year of the credit crisis, and that exchange trading has both advantages and costs compared to over-the-counter trading. Though I argue that eliminating over-the-counter trading of credit default swaps could reduce social welfare, I also recognize that much research is needed to understand better and quantify the social gains and costs of derivatives in general and credit default swaps in particular.},

The near-failure of AIG and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 have revealed the exposure of CDS's buyers to counterparty risk and hence highlighted the necessity of organizing the market, which triggered a large reform process. First we analyse the vulnerabilities of the market at the bursting of this crisis. Second, we unravel the auction process implemented to settle defaults, the strategies of buyers and sellers and the links with the bond market. We then study the way it worked for key defaults, such as Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, CIT and Thomson, as well as for the Government Sponsored Enterprises, which reveals some oddities in the final prices.

abstract = {M achines are increasingly doing " intelligent " things: Facebook recognizes faces in photos, Siri understands voices, and Google translates websites. The fundamental insight behind these breakthroughs is as much statis-tical as computational. Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the pres-ence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: Are these algorithms merely applying standard techniques to novel and large datasets? If there are fundamentally new empirical tools, how do they fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? 1 We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Central to our understanding is that machine learning 1 In this journal, Varian (2014) provides an excellent introduction to many of the more novel tools and " tricks " from machine learning, such as decision trees or cross-validation. Einav and Levin (2014) describe big data and economics more broadly. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hanson (2014) present an econometrically thorough introduction on how LASSO (and close cousins) can be used for inference in high-dimensional data. Athey (2015) provides a brief overview of how machine learning relates to causal inference.},

abstract = {Optimal regulatory restrictions on banks have to solve a delicate balance. Tighter regula- tions reduce the likelihood of banks' distress. Looser regulations foster the allocation of funds toward productive investments. With multiple banks, optimal regulation becomes even more challenging. Banks form partnerships in the interbank lending market in order to face liquidity needs and to meet investment possibilities. We show that the interbank network can suddenly collapse when regulations are pushed beyond a critical level, with a discontinuous increase in systemic risk as the cross-insurance of banks collapses. {\textcopyright}2017},

abstract = {We present a framework for quantifying the impact of fire sales in a network of financial institutions with common asset holdings, subject to leverage or capital constraints. Asset losses triggered by macro-shocks may interact with one-sided portfolio constraints, such as leverage or capital constraints, resulting in liquidation of assets, which in turn affects market prices, leading to contagion of losses and possibly new rounds of fire sales when portfolios are marked to market. Price-mediated contagion occurs through common asset holdings, which we quantify through liquidity-weighted overlaps across portfolios. Exposure to price- mediated contagion leads to the concept of indirect exposure to an asset class, as a consequence of which the risk of a portfolio depends on the matrix of asset holdings of other large and leveraged portfolios with similar assets. Our model provides an operational stress testing method for quantifying the systemic risk arising from these effects. Using data from the European Banking Authority, we examine the exposure of the EU banking system to price-mediated contagion. Our results indicate that, even with optimistic estimates of market depth, moderately large macro-shocks may trigger fire sales which may then lead to substantial losses across bank portfolios, modifying the outcome of bank stress tests. Price-mediated contagion leads to a heterogeneous cross-sectional loss distribution across banks, which cannot be replicated simply by applying a macro-shock to bank portfolios in absence of fire sales. Unlike models based on ‘leverage targeting', which assume symmetric reactions to gains or losses, our approach is based on the asymmetric interaction of portfolio losses with one-sided constraints, distinguishes between insolvency and illiquidity and leads to substantially different loss estimates in stress scenarios.},

abstract = {The Bank of England (“the Bank”) has access to some of the granular transaction level data resulting from EMIR trade reports. The velocity, granularity and richness of this dataset puts it in the realm of Big Data in the derivatives market, which brings with it its own set of challenges. These data have a number of potential uses in monitoring the market and helping to set policy. But these uses are only possible if the data are both accurate and complete on the one hand and we are able to analyse them effectively on the other. To help determine the status of these factors, we carry out a study of an external event to see how it was represented in the data. A suitable event was identified in the decision of the Swiss National Bank to discontinue the Swiss franc's floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro on the morning of 15 January 2015. This was expected to show a number of effects in the Swiss franc foreign exchange over-the-counter (FX OTC) derivatives market. The removal of the floor led to extreme price moves in the forwards market, similar to those observed in the spot market, while trading in the Swiss franc options market was practically halted. We find evidence that the rapid intraday price fluctuation was associated with poor underlying market liquidity conditions, in particular the limited provision of liquidity by dealer banks in the first hour after the event. Looking at longer-term effects, we observe a reduced level of liquidity, associated with an increased level of market fragmentation, higher market volatility and an increase in the degree of collateralisation in the weeks following the event. It is worth noting that whilst we analyse the impact of the event on the market and its visibility in the data, we are not commenting on the SNB's policy decision itself.},

CCBs are debt instruments that automatically convert to equity if and when the issuing firm or bank reaches a specified level of financial distress. CCBs have the potential to avoid bank bailouts of the type that occurred during the subprime mortgage crisis when banks could not raise sufficient new capital and bank regulators feared the consequences if systemically important banks failed. While qualitative discussions of CCBs are available in the literature, this is the first paper to develop a formal model of their properties. The paper provides analytic propositions concerning CCB attributes and develops implications for struc- turing CCBs to maximize their general benefits for corporations and their specific benefits for prudential bank regulation.

We use novel data on interbank transactions derived from TARGET2, the main euro area payment system. To identify exogenous shocks to central bank liquidity, we exploit the timing of ECB liquidity operations and use a simple structural vector auto-regression framework. We argue that the ECB acted as a de facto lender-of-last-resort to the euro area banking system and identify two main effects of central bank liquidity proxvision on interbank markets. First, central bank liquidity replaces the demand for liquidity in the interbank market, especially during the financial crisis (2008-2010). Second, it increases the supply of liquidity in the interbank market in stressed countries (Greece, Italy and Spain) during the sovereign debt crisis (2011-2013).},

abstract = {We provide a synthesis of the empirical evidence on market liquidity. We begin with an overview of  how liquidity is measured and specialized issues in liquidity measurement. We find that the liquidity  literature has established local cross-sectional patterns, global cross-sectional patterns and time-series  patterns. Commonality in liquidity is prevalent. Certain exchange designs enhance market liquidity: a  limit order book for high volume markets, a hybrid exchange for low volume markets, transparency of  the limit order book, and multiple competing exchanges. Automatic execution increases speed, but  increases spreads. A tick size reduction yields a large improvement in liquidity. Providing ex-post  transparency to an otherwise opaque market dramatically improves liquidity. Opening up the limit order  book improves liquidity. Regulatory reforms that increase the number of competitive alternatives, move  towards linking them up, and level the playing field between exchanges improves liquidity. The liquidity  and corporate finance literature provides abundant evidence that liquidity is beneficial in many corporate  settings: liquidity increases the power of governance via exit, facilitates the entrance of informed traders  who produce valuable information about the firm, enhances the effectiveness of equity-based  compensation to managers, reduces the cost of equity financing, mitigates trading frictions investors  encounter when trading in the market to recreate a preferred payout policy, and lowers the immediate  transaction costs and subsequent liquidity costs for firms conducting large share repurchases. Further,  the influence goes both ways as a broad range of corporate finance activities impact liquidity. The  literature on liquidity and asset pricing demonstrates that both average liquidity cost and liquidity risk  are priced, liquidity enhances market efficiency, and liquidity strengthens the arbitrage linkage between  related markets. We conclude with directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper shows that the network of relationships between brokers and institutional investors shapes the information diffusion in the stock market. We exploit trade-level data to show that trades channeled through central brokers earn significantly positive abnormal returns. This result is not due to differences in the investors that trade through central brokers or to stocks characteristics, as we control for this heterogeneity; nor is it the result of better trading execution. We find that a key driver of these excess returns is the information that central brokers gather by executing informed trades, which is then leaked to their best clients. We show that after large informed trades, a significantly higher volume of other investors execute similar trades through the same central broker, allowing them to capture higher returns in the first few days after the initial trade. The best clients of the broker executing the informed trade, and the asset managers affiliated with the broker, are among the first to benefit from the information about order flow. This evidence also suggests that an important source of alpha for fund managers is the access to better connections rather than superior skill. 1},

To manage this risk, banks can accumulate a buffer of liquid assets, or strengthen transparency to communicate solvency. While a liquidity buffer provides complete insurance against small shocks, transparency covers also large shocks but imperfectly. Due to leverage, an unregulated bank may choose insufficient liquidity buffers and transparency. The regulatory response is constrained: while liquidity buffers can be imposed, transparency is not verifiable. Moreover, liquidity requirements can compromise banks' transparency choices, and increase refinancing risk. To be effective, liquidity requirements should be complemented by measures that increase bank incentives to adopt transparency. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

For identification, we exploit the 2007 freeze of the European interbank market and the Italian Credit Register. After the shock, there are sizeable, aggregate double-runs. In the cross-section, credit-line drawdowns are not larger for banks more exposed to the interbank market; however, they are larger when we condition on the same firms with multiple credit lines.

abstract = {Observable covariates are useful for predicting default, but several studies question their value for explaining credit spreads. We introduce a discrete-time no-arbitrage model with observable covariates, which allows for a closed-form solution for the value of credit default swaps (CDS). The default intensity is a quadratic function of the covariates, specified such that it is always positive. The model yields economically plausible results in terms of fit, the economic impact of the covariates, and the prices of risk. Risk premiums are large and account for a smaller percentage of spreads for firms with lower credit quality. Macroeconomic and firm-specific information can explain most of the variation in CDS spreads over time and across firms, even with a parsimonious specification. These findings resolve the existing disconnect in the literature regarding the value of observable covariates for credit risk pricing and default prediction.},

abstract = {We examine the pricing of financial crash insurance during the 2007– 2009 financial crisis in US option markets, and we show that a large amount of aggregate tail risk is missing from the cost of financial sector crash insurance during the crisis. The difference in costs between out-of-the-money put options for individual banks and puts on the financial sector index increases four-fold from its precrisis 2003–2007 level. We provide evidence that a collective government guarantee for the financial sector lowers index put prices far more than those of individual banks and explains the increase in the basket-index put spread. (JEL E44, G01, G13, G21, G28, H81) Investors can purchase out-of-the-money (OTM) put options to insure their posi-tions in the event of a price crash. During the 2007–2009 financial crisis, an episode of elevated systemic risk, the price of crash insurance for the US financial sector as a whole was surprisingly low. Our paper documents that OTM put options for the financial sector stock index were extraordinarily cheap relative to OTM put options on the individual banks that comprise the index. The cost of a basket of individual bank put options exceeded the cost of the index put by 69 percent in March 2009, or by 12.4 cents per dollar of insurance. Between 2003 and 2007, before the onset of the crisis, this basket-index put spread never exceeded 3.3 cents per dollar. The increase in the basket-index spread in the financial sector during the crisis is puzzling. The basket of put options provides insurance against both sector-wide and idiosyncratic bank stock crashes, while the index put option only insures against a sector-wide crash. Standard option pricing logic therefore implies that a dispropor-tionate increase in idiosyncratic risk (relative to aggregate risk) is needed to explain the dramatic increase in the basket-index put spread during the crisis. This creates a},

Consistent with the standard microstructure literature, I find that order imbalances of end-users cause significant price impact, which depends on their direction relative to the direction of dealers' inventory. In addition, I establish that counterparty risk, measured by the level of exposure in the inter- dealer market, limits the willingness of dealers to provide liquidity. The more "congested" the interdealer market becomes from a build-up of bilateral credit exposure, the more averse deal- ers become towards inventory risk. Dealers' desire to hedge counterparty risk leads to limited intermediation in the CDS market.},

abstract = {This analysis tests the price discovery relationship between sovereign CDS premia and bond yield spreads on the same reference entity. The theoretical no-arbitrage relationship between the two credit spreads is confronted with daily data from six Euro-area countries over the period 2004-2011. As a first step, the supposed non stationarity of the two series is verified. Then, we examine whether the non-stationary CDS and bond spreads series are bound by a cointegration relationship. Overall the cointegration analysis confirms that the two prices should be equal to each other in equilibrium, as theory predicts. Nonetheless the theoretical value [1, -1] for the cointegrating vector is rejected, meaning that in the short run the cash and synthetic market's valuation of credit risk differ to various degrees. The VECM analysis suggests that the CDS market moves ahead of the bond market in terms of price discovery. These findings are further supported by the Granger Causality Test: for most sovereigns in the sample, past values of CDS spreads help to forecast bond yield spreads. Short-run deviations from the equilibrium persist longer than it would take for participants in one market to observe the price in the other. That is consistent with the hypothesis of imperfections in the arbitrage relationship between the two markets.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, a series of measures have been proposed to regulate the OTC derivatives market. The motivation is to increase the disclosure of OTC transactions aiming to decrease the probability of crisis. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how regulatory changes in the OTC derivatives market affect the non-financial sector. The Brazilian FX derivatives market provides a natural experiment for this issue: in 2011, the Brazilian government taxed short positions in FX derivatives to reduce the carry trade, which was causing the local currency to appreciate. Although Chamon and Garcia (2013, Capital control in Brazil: effective? International Monetary Fund, manuscript) find that this policy helped reduce the incentives for carry trade strategies, it could have unintended consequences on other markets. For example, if banks pass through the extra cost to clients, this taxation may affect the FX hedges of non-financial firms. This paper investigates whether, and if so how much, the increase in the cost of OTC derivatives is transferred to the non-financial sector. The results indicate that this cost more than doubled for companies exposed to devaluation of the local currency (for instance, importers). Although a thorough welfare analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, the findings suggest that this cost increase may be a concern to the extent that it could prevent EME firms from hedging their FX positions, as the NDF quotation of some EMEs is high due to the interest rate differentials.},

Despite data quality issues such as lack of information regarding duplicate trades and reference entities, we observe significant interconnectedness and concentration in the Irish CDS market. In particular, we focus on the derivative activities of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) as they are a key component of the shadow banking system. We identify SPVs who are net sellers of CDS contracts with linkages to regulated, non-domestic monetary financial institutions (MFIs). Overall, our analysis points to the importance of access to good quality micro-level regulatory data when monitoring financial stability risks. 1},

The chart was based on a similar visualization, developed by the first author, that displayed trends in music listening. This paper describes the design decisions and algorithms behind these graphics, and discusses the reaction on the Web. We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different ldquoenergy functionrdquo. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.},

We employ the Federal Reserve's Comprehen- sive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) shocks and estimate their impact on the value of CDS contracts and the variation margin owed. Large and sudden demands for variation mar- gin may exceed a firm's ability to pay, leading some firms to delay or forego payments. These shortfalls can become amplified through the network of exposures. Of particular importance in cleared markets is the potential impact on the central counterparty clearing house. Although a central node according to conventional measures of network centrality, the CCP contributes less to contagion than do several peripheral firms that are large net sellers of CDS protection. During a credit shock these firms can suffer large shortfalls that lead to further shortfalls for their counterparties, amplifying the initial shock.},

abstract = {The share of market making conducted by high-frequency trading (HFT) firms has been rising steadily. A distinguishing feature of HFTs is that they trade intraday, ending the day flat. To shed light on the economics of HFTs, and in a departure from existing market-making theories, we model an HFT that has access to unlimited leverage intraday but must fund any end-of-day inventory at an exogenously determined cost. Even though the inventory costs occur only at the end of the day, they impact intraday price and liquidity dynamics. This gives rise to an intraday endogenous price impact mechanism. As the end of the trading day approaches, the sensitivity of prices to inventory levels intensifies, making price impact stronger and widening bid-ask spreads. Moreover, imbalances of buy and sell orders may catalyze hikes and drops in prices, even under fixed supply and demand functions. Empirically, we show that these predictions are borne out in the U.S. Treasury market, where bid-ask spreads and price impact tend to rise toward the end of the day. Furthermore, price movements are negatively correlated with changes in inventory levels as measured by the cumulative net trading volume.},

Our solution technique renders the analysis fully tractable and allows us to provide a full characterization of the equilibrium, in closed form, both in and out of steady state. We use this characterization for two purposes. First, we establish that the model can naturally account for a number of stylized facts that have been documented in empirical studies of over-the-counter asset markets. In particular, we show that heterogeneity among market participants implies that assets are reallocated through “intermediation chains,” ultimately producing a core-periphery trading network and non-trivial distributions of prices and trading times. Second, we show that the model generates a number of novel results that underscore the importance of heterogeneity in decentralized markets. We highlight two: first, heterogeneity magnifies the price impact of search frictions; and second, search frictions have larger effects on price levels than on price dispersion. Hence, quantifying the price discount or premium created by search frictions based on observed price dispersion can be misleading.},

abstract = {Investment in bond mutual funds has grown rapidly in recent years. With it, there is a growing concern that they are a new source of potential fragility. While there is a vast literature on flows in equity mutual funds, relatively little research has been done on bond mutual funds. In this paper, we explore flow patterns in corporate-bond mutual funds. We show that their flows behave quite differently than those of equity mutual funds. While we confirm the well-known convex shape for equity funds' flow-to-performance over the period of our study (1992-2014), we show that during the same time, corporate bond funds exhibit no convexity. Under some performance benchmarks, corporate bond funds even exhibit a concave shape: their outflows are sensitive to bad performance more than their inflows are sensitive to good performance. Moreover, corporate bond funds tend to have more concave flow-performance relationships when they have more illiquid assets and when the overall market illiquidity is high. These results point to the possibility of fragility: The illiquidity of corporate bonds may generate a first mover advantage (or strategic complementarities) among investors in corporate-bond funds, amplifying their response to bad performance or other bad news.},

We find that generalist banks (with diversified lending) and specialist banks (with focused lending) coexist, and tend to stick to their strategies over time. Similarly, we also document the coexistence of generalist and specialist industries (based on their borrowing patterns). The observed interaction patterns in the credit market indicate a strong overlap in banks' loan portfolios, mainly due to specialist banks focusing their investments on the very same generalist industries. A stylized model matches these patterns and allows us to identify economically meaningful sets of generalist banks/industries. Lastly, we find that generalist banks are not necessarily less vulnerable to shocks compared to specialists. In fact, we show that high leverage levels can undo the benefits of diversification. Hence, banks' position in the credit network can be informative about their riskiness from a systemic perspective.},

We do so by estimating a gravity model with newly available data that contains both domestic and international holdings of individual sectors from euro area countries in individual bonds and stocks. The five holding sectors (banks, insurers, pension funds, investment funds and households) all face barriers to international investments, but these differ both across sectors and between their bond and stock holdings. Furthermore, individual security characteristics affect portfolio choice across investors differently. For bonds we find that currency denomination, coupon type, maturity and eligibility as collateral for ECB transactions stand out. For equities we find that market values, currency denomination and dividend payments are important. Since holder sectors vary in size across countries we posit that cross-country differences in sectoral composition may lead to different transmission effects of financial shocks. Keywords:},

The aggregate banking sector liquidity worsens from +{\$}5 trillion before the crisis to -{\$}3 trillion in 2008, and reverses back to the pre-crisis level in 2009. We also show how a liquidity stress test can be conducted with the LMI metric, and that such a stress test as an effective macroprudential tool could have revealed the liquidity need of the banking system in the late 2007. In the cross section, we find that banks with more liquidity mismatch have a higher crash probability in the financial crisis and have a higher chance to borrow from the government during the financial crisis. Thus our LMI measure is informative regarding both individual bank liquidity risk as well as the liquidity risk of the entire banking system.},

Intermediaries face risk-based funding constraints that give rise to procyclical leverage and a procyclical share of intermediated credit. The pricing of risk varies as a function of intermediary leverage, and asset return exposure to intermediary leverage shocks earns a positive risk premium. Relative to an economy with constant leverage, financial intermediaries generate higher consumption growth and lower consumption volatility in normal times, at the cost of endogenous systemic financial risk. The severity of systemic crisis depends on intermediaries' leverage and net worth. Regulations that tighten funding constraints affect the systemic riskreturn trade-off by lowering the likelihood of systemic crises at the cost of higher pricing of risk.},

We find that the execution price of cross-trades exhibits a 1{\%} deviation from benchmark prices on average. This deviation is more severe in fund families characterized by weak governance, large internal capital markets, and strong incentives to reallocate performance between affiliated funds. We use the introduction of new restrictive regulation to establish causality. Overall, our results suggest that cross-trades shift performance from inexpensive/unpopular funds to star funds.},

We consider the importance of market participants both to the smooth functioning of derivatives markets and in terms of their potential contribution to financial distress. In relation to market functioning, we study some measures that take into account only immediate counterparty positions and others that consider the whole counterparty network of positions. In some cases, the network of positions beyond immediate counterparties makes a significant difference to the rank ordering of the systemic importance of institutions. This means it is important for authorities responsible for financial stability to have access to data beyond the counterparty positions of institutions in their own jurisdictions. In relation to financial distress, we highlight the importance of identifying institutions which may contribute to liquidity strains, as increasing collateralisation of counterparty exposures will diminish credit risk but could at times sharply raise demand for liquid assets to post as collateral.

@article{Aymanns2015a,
abstract = {We present a simple agent-based model of a financial system composed of leveraged investors such as banks that invest in stocks and manage their risk using a Value-at-Risk constraint, based on historical observations of asset prices. The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low, leverage is high and vice versa; a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical leverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in which gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic market collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using simplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the nature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle. We introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to continuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the policy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the endogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there is always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable, countercyclical leverage policies can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the impact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank׳s riskiness via the bank׳s required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator relaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and tightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the amplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the choice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show how they can control the leverage cycle.},

We identify how the network propagates discontinuous changes in asset values triggered by failures (e.g., bankruptcies, defaults, and other insolvencies) and use that to study the consequences of integration (each organization becoming more dependent on its counterparties) and diversification (each organization interacting with a larger number of counterparties). Integration and diversification have different, nonmonotonic effects on the extent of cascades. Initial increases in diversification connect the network which permits cascades to propagate further, but eventually, more diversification makes contagion between any pair of organizations less likely as they become less dependent on each other. Integration also faces tradeoffs: increased dependence on other organizations versus less sensitivity to own investments. Finally, we illustrate some aspects of the model with data on European debt cross-holdings.},

@article{Thurner2012,
abstract = {We build a simple model of leveraged asset purchases with margin calls. Investment funds use what is perhaps the most basic financial strategy, called "value investing", i.e. systematically attempting to buy underpriced assets. When funds do not borrow, the price fluctuations of the asset are normally distributed and uncorrelated across time. All this changes when the funds are allowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than their wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives investors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As leverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered volatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations of fat tails and clustered volatility depended on "irrational behavior", such as trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits cause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally safer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage limit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately this sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is already falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward price movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at every time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard (supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks base leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of low volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making these extreme fluctuations even worse.},

However, there is a perception that crowded trades are difficult to identify. To date, no single measure to capture the crowdedness of a trade or a trading style has developed. We propose a methodology to measure crowded trades and apply it to professional currency managers. Our results suggest that carry became a crowded trading strategy towards the end of Q1 2008, shortly before a massive liquidation of carry trades. The timing suggests a possible adverse relationship between our measure of style crowdedness and the future performance of the trading style. Crowdedness in the trend following and value strategies confirm this hypothesis. We apply our approach to currencies but the methodology is general and could be used to measure the popularity or crowdedness of any trade with an identifiable time series return. Our methodology may offer useful insights regarding the popularity of certain trades in currencies, gold, or other assets among hedge funds. Further research in this area might be very relevant for investors, managers and regulators.},

abstract = {We analyze the relation between network centrality and investment performance, risk taking, and flows of funds using a network of connections established through pension funds' sharing of investment managers or consultants. We identify separate network effects established through manager or consultant connections. Network centrality is found to be positively associated with risk-adjusted return performance and growth in assets under management, after controlling for size and past performance, for domestic asset classes, but not for foreign equity holdings. Moreover, the importance of network centrality is strongest for larger funds. Better connected funds are also better able to turn past return performance into higher net inflows. More centrally placed fund managers are less likely to be fired after spells of low performance.},

abstract = {This paper studies the impact of trading profits and losses on bank counterparty borrowing costs using data from a derivatives trade depositary. We use the network of credit default swap (CDS) transactions between banks to identify bank CDS re- turns attributable to counterparty losses. Any bank's exposure to corporate default increases whenever counterparties from whom it has purchased default protection themselves experience losses. In line with this statement, we document an increase in the own CDS spread of such a bank. We find no such effect from losses of non- counterparties, nor from counterparties who have bought protection from the bank. We also find that the effect on bank CDS returns through this counterparty loss channel is large relative to the direct effect on a bank's CDS returns from its own trading losses. Our results generate the surprising implication that CDS dealers may have some understanding of their counterparties' exposures. Keywords:},

abstract = {Have you ever struggled to assess whether a potentially new research project is worth starting? If your answer to this question is “yes!”, then you need to read this paper. Or, if you have ever been daunted by the task of how to skilfully and efficiently guide a research student/early career researcher on how to identify a worthwhile area of research focus, then you need to read this paper. Or, if you are simply looking for a supplementary device to help screen quality PhD applicants, then you need to read this paper. Accordingly, this paper sets out a simple and methodical approach to pitching a new empirical research proposal. With a novice researcher in mind (e.g. Honours student, PhD student, early career researcher), a template for the pitch is provided with general advice on how best to apply it. A simple example is given (and worked through) in the area of capital structure to illustrate the specific application of the pitch template to a finance research question. To show that the pitch template is readily adaptable to many other fields of endeavour that take a quantitative/empirical approach, three such completed examples are presented for: (a) accounting; (b) corporate sustainability; and (c) an inter-disciplinary topic, at the intersection of sustainable systems/consumer behaviour. A log of the “early adopters” of the pitch template is also provided. Further, I present and discuss a range of feedback received on the earlier versions of this paper. This feedback is useful for those contemplating the application of the pitch approach. Finally, I include a section that provides general advice to users of the template – not simply from the perspective of the “pitcher” (e.g. Honours/PhD student) or the “pitchee” (e.g. supervisor), but from the perspective of other important stakeholders such as research methods instructors; postgraduate coordinators and doctoral symposium organisers.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how global financial institutions are using big data analytics within their compliance operations. A lot of previous research has focused on the strategic implications of big data, but not much research has considered how such tools are entwined with regulatory breaches and investigations in financial services. Our work covers two in-depth qualitative case studies, each addressing a distinct type of analytics. The first case focuses on analytics which manage everyday compliance breaches and so are expected by managers. The second case focuses on analytics which facilitate investigation and litigation where serious unexpected breaches may have occurred. In doing so, the study focuses on the micro/data to understand how these tools are influencing operational risks and practices. The paper draws from two bodies of literature, the social studies of information systems and finance to guide our analysis and practitioner recommendations. The cases illustrate how technologies are implicated in multijurisdictional challenges and regulatory conflicts at each end of the operational risk spectrum. We find that compliance analytics are both shaping and reporting regulatory matters yet often firms may have difficulties in recruiting individuals with relevant but diverse skill sets. The cases also underscore the increasing need for financial organizations to adopt robust information governance policies and processes to ease future remediation efforts.},

We find that prior to the crisis, banks drew on low funding rates and low-cost leverage to extend dollar credit to non-US borrowers. After the Federal Reserve announced its large-scale bond purchases in 2008, however, bond investors responded to compressed long-term rates by buying dollar bonds from non-US borrowers.

The nodes of each multiplex are the different urban locations whereas links represent the existence of a trip from one node (origin) to another (destination). On the other hand, the different layers of each multiplex correspond to the different existing transportation modes. By exploiting the characterization of multiplex transportation networks combining different transportation modes, we aim at characterizing the mobility patterns of each subset of the population. Our results show that the socioeconomic characteristics of the population have an extraordinary impact in the layer organization of these multiplex systems.},

abstract = {The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, spurred extraordinary efforts intended to protect America from the newly highlighted scourge of international terrorism. Among the efforts was the consideration and possible use of “data mining” as a way to discover planning and preparation for ter- rorism. Data mining is the process of searching data for previously unknown patterns and using those patterns to predict future outcomes. Information about key members of the 9/11 plot was available to the U.S. government prior to the attacks, and the 9/11 terrorists were close- ly connected to one another in a multitude of ways. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States concluded that, by pursuing the leads available to it at the time, the government might have derailed the plan. Though data mining has many valuable uses, it is not well suited to the terrorist discovery problem. It would be unfortunate if data mining for terrorism discovery had currency within national security, law enforcement, and technol- ogy circles because pursuing this use of data mining would waste taxpayer dollars, needlessly infringe on privacy and civil liberties, and misdi- rect the valuable time and energy of the men and women in the national security community. What the 9/11 story most clearly calls for is a sharper focus on the part of our national securi- ty agencies—their focus had undoubtedly sharp- ened by the end of the day on September 11, 2001—along with the ability to efficiently locate, access, and aggregate information about specific suspects.},

We investigate whether financial institutions that are active buyers of protection from a specific counterparty undertake succes- sive contracts and purchase protection written on them, while avoiding wrong-way risk mitigation. The trading intensive dealer banks are more active in hedging both over short and longer horizons, whereas non-dealer banks manage this risk only over longer, monthly intervals. Higher stock return and CDS price volatility, lower past stock returns, and higher CDS prices of the counterparty are shown to have an increasing effect on the hedging behaviour against the counterparty. In addition to its usage for ongoing CVA risk-mitigation activities, purchasing protection on coun- terparties is shown to be a viable instrument beyond receiving coverage through collateral.},

abstract = {Supervisory stress testing to date has focused on the resiliency of large banks to withstand the direct effects of a credit shock. Using data from Depository Trust {\&} Clearing Corporation (DTCC), we apply the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory scenarios to evaluate the default of a bank's largest counterparty. We find that indirect effects of this default, through the bank's other counterparties, are larger than the direct impact on the bank. Further, when taken as a whole, the core banking system has a higher concentration to a single counterparty than does any individual bank holding company. Under the 2015 stress, the banking system's counterparty credit concentration is high and corresponds in diversity to a market with just over three firms. Our results are the first to evaluate the credit derivatives market under stress and also underscore the importance of a macroprudential perspective on stress testing.},

To answer these questions we couple comprehensive CDS trading data at the bank- firm level from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation with a credit register containing bank-firm credit exposures. We find that following the Small Bang in the European corporate CDS market extant credit relationships with riskier firms increase banks' CDS trading and hedging of these firms. If banks hold more CDS contracts of safer firms they consequently supply more credit to them. Following the Small Bang banks overall do not seem to take more risk.},

abstract = {Networks pervade social and economic life, and they play a prominent role in explaining a huge variety of social and economic phenomena. Standard economic theory did not give much credit to the role of networks until the early 1990s, but since then the study of the theory of networks has blossomed. At the heart of this research is the idea that the pattern of connections between individual rational agents shapes their actions and determines their rewards. The importance of connections has in turn motivated the study of the very processes by which networks are formed. In Connections, Sanjeev Goyal puts contemporary thinking about networks and economic activity into context. He develops a general framework within which this body of research can be located. In the first part of the book he demonstrates that location in a network has significant effects on individual rewards and that, given this, it is natural that individuals will seek to form connections to move the network in their favor. This idea motivates the second part of the book, which develops a general theory of network formation founded on individual incentives. Goyal assesses the robustness of current research findings and identifies the substantive open questions. Written in a style that combines simple examples with formal models and complete mathematical proofs, Connections is a concise and self-contained treatment of the economic theory of networks, one that should become the natural source of reference for graduate students in economics and related disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2007 by Princeton University Press.

Since the 2008 crisis, there has been increasing interest in using ideas from complexity theory to make sense of economic and financial markets. Concepts, such as tipping points, networks, contagion, feedback, and resilience have entered the financial and regulatory lexicon, but actual use of complexity models and results remains at an early stage.

abstract = {We study financial markets where agents share risks, but have incentives to default and their financial positions might not be transparent, that is, might not be mutually observable. We show that a lack of position transparency results in a counterparty risk externality, that manifests itself in the form of excess "leverage," in that parties take on short positions that lead to levels of default risk that are higher than Pareto efficient ones. This externality is absent when trading is organized via a centralized clearing mechanism that provides transparency of trade positions. Collateral requirements and especially subordination of non-transparent positions in bankruptcy can ameliorate the counterparty risk externality in market settings such as over-the-counter (OTC) markets which feature a lack of position transparency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The estimated collateral demands include initial margin and the frictional demands associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across market participants.},

The model incorporates multiple sources of systemic risk, including size of financial institutions, direct exposure from interbank lendings, and asset fire sales. We suggest a new macroprudential risk management approach building on a system wide value at risk (SVaR). Under the SVaR metric, the contribution of individual banks to systemic risk is well defined and can be approximated by a Shapley value-type measure. We show that, in a SVaR regime, a fair systemic risk charge which is proportional to a bank's individual contribution to systemic risk diverges from the optimal macroprudential capitalization of the banks from a planner's perspective. The results have implications for the design of macroprudential capital surcharges. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Since the 2008 crisis, there has been increasing interest in using ideas from complexity theory to make sense of economic and financial markets. Concepts, such as tipping points, networks, contagion, feedback, and resilience have entered the financial and regulatory lexicon, but actual use of complexity models and results remains at an early stage. Recent insights and techniques offer potential for better monitoring and management of highly interconnected economic and financial systems and, thus, may help anticipate and manage future crises.$\backslash$nEconomic policy needs interdisciplinary network analysis and behavioral modeling$\backslash$nEconomic policy needs interdisciplinary network analysis and behavioral modeling},

In turn, a reduction in their total$\backslash$ncapital increases CDS spreads. Capital fluctuations of the largest five sellers account for more$\backslash$nthan 10 percent of the time-series variation in spread changes, a significant amount given that$\backslash$nobservable firm and macroeconomic factors account for less than 17 percent of variation during$\backslash$nthis time period. I then demonstrate that the concentration of sellers creates fragility - higher$\backslash$nconcentration results in more volatile risk premiums. I also employ a number of complimentary$\backslash$napproaches to address identification, such as using the 2011 Japanese tsunami as an exogenous$\backslash$nshock to the risk bearing capacity of CDS traders. My findings are consistent with asset pricing$\backslash$nmodels with limited investment capital, but also suggest that both the level and distribution$\backslash$nof capital are crucial for accurately describing price dynamics.},

abstract = {Risk contagion in the banking sector occurs through interconnections on the asset side or through liquidity spirals affecting the liability side. We build a network model of optimizing banks featuring contagion on both sides of banks' balance sheets. To already existing asset side channels (liquidity hoarding, interbank exposures and fire sales of common assets) we add a critical liability side channel of contagion, namely bank runs triggered by information coordination akin to global games. The model is calibrated to the network of large European banks by a simulated method of moments approach and by using the real‐world interbank matrix as a prior for the maximum entropy estimation of the model‐based interbank matrix. We use the model to study the effects of phase‐in increases of liquidity coverage ratios. Interestingly we find that the systemic risk profile of the system is not improved and might even deteriorate. Based on those insights we propose an alternative approach: differential (across banks) increases in coverage ratios based on systemic importance rankings help to mitigate},

abstract = {A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is an insurance contract built upon transfer of underlying risk and the creation of counterparty risk. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical results about the complex network arising from this set of risk transfers. First, we formalise the notion of flow-of-risk and show that, in a CDS network, underlying and counterparty risk flow in opposite directions. We provide sufficient conditions for a bow-tie network architecture to endogenously emerge as a result of intermediation. This architecture shows three distinct set of counterparties: i) a set of Ultimate Risk Sellers (URS), ii) a set of dealers indirectly exposed to each other risk, and iii) a set of Ultimate Risk Buyers (URB). We show that the probability of a widespread systemic loss due to counterparty risk is higher in a bow-tie architecture than in more fragmented network structures. The failure of an URB or a dealer may lead to a significant impact on a very large part of the system. Empirically, we use a unique global dataset of CDS bilateral exposures on major sovereign and financial reference entities in the years 2011 − 2014. We find that the CDS network shows precisely a bow-tie network architecture for the vast majority of reference entities across the four time snapshots. By identifying URSs and URBs, we are able to understand in which sectors of the global economy the flow-of-risk originates and in which sectors it ends up. The flow-of-risk originates from a large number of URSs and ends up in a very few leading URBs, the largest majority of which are non-banks. The analysis of the CDS portfolio composition of the URBs shows a high level of concentration in the market; in particular, the top URBs often show large exposures to potentially correlated reference entities.

The purpose is to show how one can isolate the volatility of a risk factor from other related risks, and then construct instruments that can be used to trade it. Liquid instruments that involve pure volatility trades are potentially very useful for market participants who have natural exposure to various volatilities in their balance sheet or trading book. When a trader takes a position or hedges a risk, he or she expects that the random movements of the underlying would have a known effect on the position. The underlying may be random, but the payoff function of a well-defined contract or a position has to be known. Payoff functions of most classical volatility strategies are not invariant to underlying risks, and most volatility instruments turn out to be imperfect tools for isolating this risk. Even when traders' anticipations come true, the trader may realize that the underlying volatility payoff functions have changed due to movements in other variables. Hence, classical volatility strategies cannot provide satisfactory hedges for volatility exposures. The reason for this and possible solutions are given in the chapter.},

A key role is played by the long intermediation chains inherent to the structure of theOTC network, which may turn into chains of critical receivables. We calibrate our model to data representing net and gross OTC exposures of large dealer banks and use this model to investigate the impact of central clearing on network stability. We find that, when interest rate swaps are cleared, central clearing of credit default swaps through a well-capitalized CCP can reduce the probability and the magnitude of a systemic illiquidity spiral by reducing the length of the chains of critical receivables within the financial network. These benefits are reduced, however, if some large intermediaries are not included as clearing members.},

abstract = {Over-the-counter derivatives (OTCDs) have been at the centre of regulators' and policymakers' attention owing to widespread concerns that these markets contributed to the build-up of systemic risk in the 2007/08 financial crisis. In 2009 the G20 initiated a reform programme that aims to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk in these markets. This paper analyses the structure and dynamics in one segment of the OTCD market, namely the UK single-name credit default swap (CDS) market. For our analysis, we use transaction reports warehoused in the trade repository operated by the Depository Trust {\&} Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The data span the time between January 2007 and December 2011 which enables us to take a close look at market activity during the financial crisis. The data show that the UK CDS market is relatively small (in terms of values traded) and that trading is infrequent. Furthermore, activity is highly concentrated around the main dealers who provide liquidity by intermediating between ultimate CDS buyers and sellers. Importantly, the data also show that dealers continued to provide liquidity throughout and during the peak of the financial crisis. Thus, concerns about counterparty risk, which are inherently present in all OTCDs, did not seem to have impaired market functioning in the UK CDS market. Corroborating this, counterparty risk did not affect CDS trade execution prices, in the sense that dealer credit risk did not correlate with the prices at which dealers were able to sell protection. Finally, the data also show that there are no substantial differences in the execution prices of the various types of counterparties: most market end-users trade at approximately the same prices at which dealers trade with one another. This is an interesting finding given the opacity of this OTCD market. From a more general point of view, this paper demonstrates the usefulness of trade repository data to regulators. Such data allow regulators to understand better the dynamics of these hitherto opaque OTCD markets and also to estimate derivatives exposures arising between the various counterparties, which is essential for supervision and prudential policy. On-going work with trade repository data at the Bank of England aims to examine these interconnections in more detail},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {How do markets for debt cash flow rights, with and without accompanying control rights, affect the efficiency of lending? A bank makes a loan, learns if it needs monitoring, and then decides whether to lay off credit risk. The bank can transfer credit risk by either selling the loan or buying a credit default swap (CDS). With a CDS, the originating bank retains the loan's control rights; with loan sales, control rights pass to the loan buyer. Credit risk transfer leads to excessive monitoring of riskier credits and insufficient monitoring of safer credits. Increases in banks' cost of equity capital exacerbate these effects. For riskier credits, loan sales typically dominate CDS but not for safer credits. Once repeated lending and consequent reputation concerns are modeled, although CDSs remain dominated by loan sales for riskier credits, for safer credits they can dominate loan sales, supporting better monitoring (albeit to a limited extent) while allowing efficient risk sharing. Restrictions on the bank's ability to sell the loan expand the range in which CDSs are used and monitoring is too low. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The proliferation of financial instruments apparently provides more means for risk diversification, making the market more efficient and complete. In the simple market of interacting traders discussed here, the proliferation of financial instruments erodes systemic stability and it drives the market to a critical state characterized by large susceptibility, strong fluctuations and enhanced correlations among risks. This suggests that the hypothesis of APT may not be compatible with a stable market dynamics. In this perspective, market stability acquires the properties of a common good, which suggests that appropriate measures should be introduced in derivative markets, to preserve stability.},

Here we study a set of 176 CDS time series of financial institutions from 2002 to 2011. Networks are constructed in various ways, some of which display structural change at the onset of the credit crisis of 2008, but never before. By taking these networks as a proxy of interdependencies among financial institutions, we run stress-test based on Group DebtRank. Systemic risk before 2008 increases only when incorporating a macroeconomic indicator reflecting the potential losses of financial assets associated with house prices in the US.

@article{Giglio2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to measure the joint default risk of large financial institutions (systemic default risk) using information in bond and credit default swap (CDS) prices. Bond prices reflect individual default probabilities of the issuers. CDS contracts, which insure against such defaults, pay off only as long as the seller of protection itself is solvent. Therefore, CDS prices contain information about the probability of joint default of both the bond issuer and the protection seller. If we consider the entire set of CDS contracts written by each financial institution against the default of each other institution we can learn about all pairwise default probabilities across the financial network. This information, however, is not sufficient to completely characterize the joint distribution function of defaults of these banks. In this paper, I show how this information can be optimally aggregated to construct bounds on the probability of systemic default events. This method enables me to measure systemic default risk without making any assumptions about the joint distribution function. Two main results emerge from the empirical application of this method to the recent financial crisis. First, I show that an increase in systemic risk in large global banks did not occur until after Bear Stearn's collapse in March 2008. Second, some of the large observed spikes in CDS spreads and bond yield spreads during this period (for example, following Lehman Brothers' default) correspond to spikes in idiosyncratic default risk rather than systemic risk.},

We discuss various metrics that have been proposed for evaluating the susceptibility of the system to contagion and suggest directions for future research.},

As insurers often reinsure themselves with other (re)insurers, a firm's loss could spread contagiously through the sector. Using a unique and confidential data set on reinsurance exposures, we gain insight into the reinsurance market structure and perform a scenario analysis to measure contagion risks. Considering entities on a standalone basis, we find no evidence of systemic risk in the Netherlands, even if multiple reinsurance companies fail simultaneously. At group level our analysis points to the contagion risk of in-house reinsurance structures, given that such in-house reinsurance parties are generally not higher capitalised than other group members. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Regardless of the specification of the model, the degree of inflation aversion - relative to unemployment - plays an important role. In this paper I estimate inflation aversion at the individual level from survey data, and test the theoretical assumptions used for various models. The results show that income has a small role in explaining aversion to inflation and that redistributional motivation and political inclination have more significant effects.},

The paper develops a model that associates crowdfunding with pre-ordering and price discrimination, and studies the conditions under which crowdfunding is preferred to traditional forms of external funding. Compared to traditional funding, crowdfunding has the advantage of offering an enhanced experience to some consumers and, thereby, of allowing the entrepreneur to practice menu pricing and extract a larger share of the consumer surplus; the disadvantage is that the entrepreneur is constrained in his/her choice of prices by the amount of capital that he/she needs to raise: the larger this amount, the more prices have to be twisted so as to attract a large number of “crowdfunders” who pre-order, and the less profitable the menu pricing scheme.},

This paper uses daily data compiled by the author from the records of the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over the period March 1, 1984, through December 31, 1996: He analyzes the Desk???s use of its operating procedure in implementing monetary policy and the extent to which open market operations affect the federal funds rate???the liquidity effect. The author finds that the operating procedure was used to guide daily open market operations; however, there is little evidence of a liquidity effect at the daily frequency and even less evidence at lower frequencies. Consistent with the absence of a liquidity effect, open market operations appear to be a relatively unimportant source of liquidity to the federal funds market.

Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

abstract = {After August 2007 the plumbing system that supplied banks with wholesale funding, the interbank market, failed because toxic assets obstructed the pipes. Banks were forced to squeeze liquidity in a “lemons market” or to ask for liquidity “on tap” from central banks. This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor–Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a “lemons market” and relied on liquidity “on tap” even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe.},

abstract = {Using plausibly exogenous variation in demand for federal funds created by daily shocks to reserve balances, we identify the supply curve facing a bank borrower in the interbank market and study how access to overnight credit is affected by changes in public and private measures of borrower creditworthiness. Although there is evidence that lenders respond to adverse changes in public information about credit quality by restricting access to the market in a fashion consistent with market discipline, there is also evidence that borrowers respond to adverse changes in private information about credit quality by increasing leverage so as to offset the future impact on earnings. While the responsiveness of investors to public information is comforting, we document evidence that suggests that banks are able to manage the real information content of these disclosures. In particular, public measures of loan portfolio performance have information about future loan charge-offs, but only in quarters when the bank is examined by supervisors. However, the loan supply curve is not any more sensitive to public disclosures about nonperforming loans in an exam quarter, suggesting that investors are unaware of this information management.},

We analyze the micro and macroeconomic determinants of this phenomenon, finding that before August 2007 interbank rates were insensitive to borrower characteristics, whereas afterwards they became reactive to borrowers' creditworthiness. At the same time, conditions for large borrowers became relatively more favorable, both before and after the failure of Lehman Brothers. This suggests that banks have become more discerning in their lending, a welcome change, but that moral hazard considerations related to the ”too big to fail” argument should remain a main concern for central banks.},

abstract = {After August 2007 the plumbing system that supplied banks with wholesale funding, the interbank market, failed because toxic assets obstructed the pipes. Banks were forced to squeeze liquidity in a “lemons market” or to ask for liquidity “on tap” from central banks. This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor–Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a “lemons market” and relied on liquidity “on tap” even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe.},

abstract = {Some have argued that recent increases in credit risk transfer are desirable because they improve the diversification of risk. Others have suggested that they may be undesirable if they increase the risk of financial crises. Using a model with banking and insurance sectors, we show that credit risk transfer can be beneficial when banks face uniform demand for liquidity. However, when they face idiosyncratic liquidity risk and hedge this risk in an interbank market, credit risk transfer can be detrimental to welfare. It can lead to contagion between the two sectors and increase the risk of crises. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Rufibach2011,
abstract = {Publication bias, the fact that studies identified for inclusion in a meta analysis do not represent all studies on the topic of interest, is commonly recognized as a threat to the validity of a meta analysis. One way to explicitly model publication bias is via weighted probability distributions. We adopt the non-parametric approach initially introduced by Dear and Begg (1992) but impose that the weight function w is monotonely non-increasing as a function of the p-value. Since in meta analysis one typically only has few studies or "observations," regularization of the estimation problem seems sensible. In addition, virtually all parametric weight functions proposed so far in the literature are in fact decreasing. We discuss how to estimate a decreasing weight function in the above model and illustrate the new methodology on two well-known examples. Some basic properties of the log-likelihood function and computation of a p-value quantifying the evidence against the null hypothesis of a constant weight function are indicated. In addition, we provide an approximate selection bias adjusted profile likelihood confidence interval for the treatment effect. The corresponding software and the data sets used to illustrate it are provided as the R package selectMeta (Rufibach, 2011).},

abstract = {After August 2007 the plumbing system that supplied banks with wholesale funding, the interbank market, failed because toxic assets obstructed the pipes. Banks were forced to squeeze liquidity in a “lemons market” or to ask for liquidity “on tap” from central banks. This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor–Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a “lemons market” and relied on liquidity “on tap” even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe. },

abstract = {After August 2007 the plumbing system that supplied banks with wholesale funding, the interbank market, failed because toxic assets obstructed the pipes. Banks were forced to squeeze liquidity in a “lemons market” or to ask for liquidity “on tap” from central banks. This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor–Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a “lemons market” and relied on liquidity “on tap” even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe. },

We analyze the micro and macroeconomic determinants of this phenomenon, finding that before August 2007 interbank rates were insensitive to borrower characteristics, whereas afterwards they became reactive to borrowers' creditworthiness. At the same time, conditions for large borrowers became relatively more favorable, both before and after the failure of Lehman Brothers. This suggests that banks have become more discerning in their lending, a welcome change, but that moral hazard considerations related to the ”too big to fail” argument should remain a main concern for central banks.},

Two competing theories explain the observed patterns: private information about future security prices and trading stoppages. The Federal funds market allows a unique opportunity to study the causes of intraday patterns because private information common to most markets does not play a role in setting prices. We find reverse-J variance patterns while accounting for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model effects. Our results support trading stops as an explanation for the reverse-J pattern and suggest that private information is not a necessary condition for the observed pattern.},

Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

Banks were forced to squeeze liquidity in a “lemons market” or to ask for liquidity “on tap” from central banks. This paper disentangles the two components of the 3-month Euribor–Eonia swap spread, credit and liquidity risk and then evaluates the decomposition. The main finding is that credit risk increased before the key events of the crisis, while liquidity risk was mainly responsible for the subsequent increases in the Euribor spread and then reacted to the systemic responses of the central banks, especially in October 2008. Moreover, the level of the spread between May 2009 and February 2010 was influenced mainly by credit risk, suggesting that European banks were still in a “lemons market” and relied on liquidity “on tap” even before sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe.},

@article{Rufibach2011,
abstract = {Publication bias, the fact that studies identified for inclusion in a meta analysis do not represent all studies on the topic of interest, is commonly recognized as a threat to the validity of a meta analysis. One way to explicitly model publication bias is via weighted probability distributions. We adopt the non-parametric approach initially introduced by Dear and Begg (1992) but impose that the weight function w is monotonely non-increasing as a function of the p-value. Since in meta analysis one typically only has few studies or "observations," regularization of the estimation problem seems sensible. In addition, virtually all parametric weight functions proposed so far in the literature are in fact decreasing. We discuss how to estimate a decreasing weight function in the above model and illustrate the new methodology on two well-known examples. Some basic properties of the log-likelihood function and computation of a p-value quantifying the evidence against the null hypothesis of a constant weight function are indicated. In addition, we provide an approximate selection bias adjusted profile likelihood confidence interval for the treatment effect. The corresponding software and the data sets used to illustrate it are provided as the R package selectMeta (Rufibach, 2011).},

abstract = {Using plausibly exogenous variation in demand for federal funds created by daily shocks to reserve balances, we identify the supply curve facing a bank borrower in the interbank market and study how access to overnight credit is affected by changes in public and private measures of borrower creditworthiness. Although there is evidence that lenders respond to adverse changes in public information about credit quality by restricting access to the market in a fashion consistent with market discipline, there is also evidence that borrowers respond to adverse changes in private information about credit quality by increasing leverage so as to offset the future impact on earnings. While the responsiveness of investors to public information is comforting, we document evidence that suggests that banks are able to manage the real information content of these disclosures. In particular, public measures of loan portfolio performance have information about future loan charge-offs, but only in quarters when the bank is examined by supervisors. However, the loan supply curve is not any more sensitive to public disclosures about nonperforming loans in an exam quarter, suggesting that investors are unaware of this information management.},

Others have suggested that they may be undesirable if they increase the risk of financial crises. Using a model with banking and insurance sectors, we show that credit risk transfer can be beneficial when banks face uniform demand for liquidity. However, when they face idiosyncratic liquidity risk and hedge this risk in an interbank market, credit risk transfer can be detrimental to welfare. It can lead to contagion between the two sectors and increase the risk of crises. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is commonly believed that the Fed???s ability to control the federal funds rate stems from its ability to alter the supply of liquidity in the overnight market through open market operations. This paper uses daily data compiled by the author from the records of the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over the period March 1, 1984, through December 31, 1996: He analyzes the Desk???s use of its operating procedure in implementing monetary policy and the extent to which open market operations affect the federal funds rate???the liquidity effect. The author finds that the operating procedure was used to guide daily open market operations; however, there is little evidence of a liquidity effect at the daily frequency and even less evidence at lower frequencies. Consistent with the absence of a liquidity effect, open market operations appear to be a relatively unimportant source of liquidity to the federal funds market. (JEL E43, E52) Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, November/December 2007, 89(6), pp. 549-70. It is important to note that the operating pro- cedure is intended only to provide the Desk with guidance in conducting daily open market oper-ations. It was never intended to be strictly adhered to.

abstract = {The basic idea of crowdfunding is to raise external finance from a large audience (the “crowd”), where each individual provides a very small amount, instead of soliciting a small group of sophisticated investors. The paper develops a model that associates crowdfunding with pre-ordering and price discrimination, and studies the conditions under which crowdfunding is preferred to traditional forms of external funding. Compared to traditional funding, crowdfunding has the advantage of offering an enhanced experience to some consumers and, thereby, of allowing the entrepreneur to practice menu pricing and extract a larger share of the consumer surplus; the disadvantage is that the entrepreneur is constrained in his/her choice of prices by the amount of capital that he/she needs to raise: the larger this amount, the more prices have to be twisted so as to attract a large number of “crowdfunders” who pre-order, and the less profitable the menu pricing scheme.},

abstract = {The properties of the interbank market have been discussed widely in the literature. However a proper model selection between alternative organizations of the network in a small number of blocks, for example bipartite, core-periphery, and modular, has not been performed. In this paper, by inferring a Stochastic Block Model on the e-MID interbank market in the period 2010-2014, we show that in normal conditions the network is organized either as a bipartite structure or as a three community structure, where a group of intermediaries mediates between borrowers and lenders. In exceptional conditions, such as after LTRO, one of the most important unconventional measure by ECB at the beginning of 2012, the most likely structure becomes a random one and only in 2014 the e-MID market went back to a normal bipartite organization. By investigating the strategy of individual banks, we show that the disappearance of many lending banks and the strategy switch of a very small set of banks from borrower to lender is likely at the origin of this structural change.},

Network centrality is found to be positively associated with risk-adjusted return performance and growth in assets under management, after controlling for size and past performance, for domestic asset classes, but not for foreign equity holdings. Moreover, the importance of network centrality is strongest for larger funds. Better connected funds are also better able to turn past return performance into higher net inflows. More centrally placed fund managers are less likely to be fired after spells of low performance.},

abstract = {When a bank experiences a negative shock to its equity, one way to return to target leverage is to sell assets. If asset sales occur at depressed prices, then one bank's sales may impact other banks with common exposures, resulting in contagion. We propose a simple framework that accounts for how this effect adds up across the banking sector. Our framework explains how the distribution of bank leverage and risk exposures contributes to a form of systemic risk. We compute bank exposures to system-wide deleveraging, as well as the spillover of a single bank's deleveraging onto other banks. We show how our model can be used to evaluate a variety of crisis interventions, such as mergers of good and bad banks and equity injections. We apply the framework to European banks vulnerable to sovereign risk in 2010 and 2011.},

abstract = {This paper examines alternative ways to prevent losses from bank insolvencies.
It is widely viewed that transparency in reporting bank balance sheets
is a key element in reducing such losses. It is, however, unclear
just how such transparency would be achieved. Current approaches
to avoiding insolvencies generally involve international enforcement
mechanisms. Among these are the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism
(SDRM), and, more generally, an international bankruptcy court. We
develop a model that compares two alternative institutions for bank
auditing. Neither of these institutions would require as much enforcement
capability as an international bankruptcy court, hence they would
be easier to introduce. The first of these is a system of central
bank auditing of national banks. The second type of auditing is carried
out by an international agency that collects risk information on
banks in all countries and then provides it to depositors. Using
a game-theoretic approach, we compare the informativeness of the
disclosure rule in the symmetric Perfect Bayesian equilibrium in
each of the two different auditing institutions. We show that the
international auditor generally performs at least as well, and sometimes
better than, auditing by either central banks, which, in turn, perform
better than voluntary disclosure by the banks themselves. The results
do not assume any informational advantages of the international auditor,
nor is the international auditor somehow less {\#}corrupt{\#} than the
central banks. Rather, the international auditor's credibility comes
from the simple fact that its incentives are not distorted by a sovereignty
bias that plagues the central banks.},

abstract = {abstract The theory of financial intermediation highlights various channels through which capital and liquidity are interrelated. Using a simultaneous equations framework, we investigate the relationship between bank regulatory capital and bank liquidity measured from on-balance sheet positions for European and US publicly traded commercial banks. Previous research studying the determinants of bank capital buffer has neglected the role of liquidity. On the whole, we find that banks decrease their regulatory capital ratios when they face higher illiquidity as defined in the Basel III accords or when they create more liquidity as measured by Berger and Bouwman (2009). However, considering other measures of illiquidity that focus more closely on core deposits in the United States, our results show that small banks strengthen their solvency standards when they are exposed to higher illiquidity. Our empirical investiga- tion supports the need to implement minimum liquidity ratios concomitant to capital ratios, as stressed by the Basel Committee; however, our findings also shed light on the need to further clarify how to define and measure illiquidity and also on how to regulate large banking institutions, which behave differently than smaller ones.},

abstract = {The financial crises in 2008 highlights the importance of detecting crowded trades due to the risks they pose to the stability of the financial system and to the global economy. However, there is a perception that crowded trades are difficult to identify. To date, no single measure to capture the crowdedness of a trade or a trading style has developed. We propose a methodology to measure crowded trades and apply it to professional currency managers. Our results suggest that carry became a crowded trading strategy towards the end of Q1 2008, shortly before a massive liquidation of carry trades. The timing suggests a possible adverse relationship between our measure of style crowdedness and the future performance of the trading style. Crowdedness in the trend following and value strategies confirm this hypothesis. We apply our approach to currencies but the methodology is general and could be used to measure the popularity or crowdedness of any trade with an identifiable time series return. Our methodology may offer useful insights regarding the popularity of certain trades in currencies, gold, or other assets among hedge funds. Further research in this area might be very relevant for investors, managers and regulators.},

We find that internal capital markets transmit favorable and adverse shocks by affecting subsidiaries' reliance on their own internal funds for lending. We also find that the transmission of financial shocks varies across types of shocks; is strongest among subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe, followed by Asia and Latin America; is global rather than regional; and becomes more conspicuous in recent years. We also explore various conditions under which the international transmission of financial shocks via internal capital markets in multinational banking is stronger, including the subsidiaries' reliance on funds from their parent bank, the subsidiaries' entry mode, and the capital account openness and banking market structure in host countries.},

We find that discounts for illiquidity can be surprisingly large, approaching 30 to 50 percent in some cases. Immediacy plays a unique role and is valued much more than ongoing liquidity. We show that investors in illiquid enterprises have strong incentives to increase dividends and other cash payouts, thereby introducing potential agency conflicts. We also find that illiquidity and volatility are fundamentally entangled in their effects on asset prices. This aspect may help explain why some assets are viewed as inherently more liquid than others and why liquidity concerns are heightened during financial crises.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.},

In this paper, we focus on the Interest Rate Swap (IRS) segment as a significant fraction of the OTC market. We define a distress indi- cator by combining some distress drivers, such as averaged volumes, liquidity, volatility and bid-ask proxies. Hence, we analyse the distress dependencies among sub-markets identified by the segmentation of the IRS market according to contractual and financial features. We try to combine in an innovative way some new ingredients, namely the more granular data on OTC derivatives available from the trade repositories along with the classical JPoD ap- proach introduced in the recent years by the IMF for studying the distress interdependence structure among financial institutions. The proposed technique seems to be quite promising. Indeed, the results are quite close to the practical intuition. At the best of our knowledge, this work is the first empirical study based on trade repositories' data for assessing systemic risk},

The effect is largest for state‐owned or supported banks with low initial holdings of domestic sovereign bonds. We eliminate alternative explanations related to regulatory distortions, risk shifting, carry‐trade‐like behavior, or shocks to the supply of deposits or the demand for loans. We also show that this effect is not associated with a crowding out of private lending, suggesting that moral suasion of banks does not necessarily have negative real short‐run effects in an environment of abundant central bank liquidity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the interconnectedness of banks and the price they pay for liquidity. We assess how the concentration of credit relationships and the position of a bank in the network topology of the system influence the bank's ability to meet liquidity demand. We use quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposure among all German banks from 2000 to 2008 to measure interbank relationships and network characteristics. We match these data with bids placed by individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank's willingness to pay for liquidity, since they had variable rate tenders with a “pay-your-bid” price. Controlling for bank characteristics and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a lower price for liquidity in the ECB's main refinancing operations. These findings suggest that incentives to diversify banks' liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information. When the network position of the bank is taken into account, we find that central lenders in the money market bid more aggressively in auctions.},

abstract = {Peter Schuck catalogs an overwhelming list of US government failures. He pointsto both structural problems (culture and institutions) and incentives. Despairing of cultural change, Schuck focuses on incentives. He relies on Charles Wolf 's theory of nonmarket failures in which “internalities” replace the heavily-studied market failure from externalities (Wolf 1979). Internalities are evidence of a discord between the public goals by which a program is defended and the private goals of its administrators. What might economists contribute? We suggest that economists have neglected internalities because they take group goals as exogenously determined and we defend an alternative tradition in which group goals are endogenously determined.

This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .},

abstract = {During election campaigns, political parties deliver statements on salient issues in the news media, which are called issue positions. This article conceptualizes issue positions as a valued and longitudinal two-mode network of parties by issues. The network is valued because parties pronounce pro or con positions on issues in more or less extreme ways. It is longitudinal because the media report new statements of parties on issues each new day.In political science, issue positions are often assumed to be stable throughout the election campaign but this article shows that parties adjust their issue positions systematically to the issue positions of other parties. Applying concepts from social network analysis, notably structural balance and transitivity, we analyze the evolution of the network of issue positions showing that issue positions adopted previously by other parties as well as previous reports on support and criticism among parties have substantial and statistically significant effects on subsequent issue positions.Our dynamic adjustment model is estimated by means of a two-mode network autoregression model with cross-nested random effects. The data about issue positions and support and criticism among parties come from a daily content analysis of newspaper and television news during the Dutch national election campaign in 2006. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Using transaction-level data for a broad cross-section of corporate bonds from 2003 through 2007, we find the illiquidity in corporate bonds to be significant, substantially greater than what can be explained by bid-ask bounce, and closely linked to liquidity-related bond characteristics. More importantly, we find a strong commonality in the time variation of bond illiquidity, which rises sharply during market crises and reaches an all-time high during the recent sub-prime mortgage crisis. Monthly changes in this aggregate bond illiquidity are strongly related to changes in the CBOE VIX Index and lagged stock market returns. Examining its relation with bond pricing, we find that our measure of illiquidity explains the cross-sectional variation in average bond yield spreads with large economic significance.},

abstract = {Systemic risk among the network of international banking groups arises when financial stress threatens to criss-cross many national boundaries and expose imperfect international co-ordination. To assess this risk, we apply an information theoretic map equation due to Martin Rosvall and Carl Bergstrom to partition banking groups from 21 countries into modules. The resulting modular structure reflects the flow of financial stress through the network, combining nodes that are most closely related in terms of the transmission of stress. The modular structure of the international banking network has changed dramatically over the past three decades. In the late 1980s four important financial centres formed one large supercluster that was highly contagious in terms of transmission of stress within its ranks, but less contagious on a global scale. Since then the most influential modules have become significantly smaller and more broadly contagious. The analysis contributes to our understanding as to why defaults in US sub-prime mortgages had such large global implications.},

However, the information on financial network structure is not available. This paper builds a probabilistic graphical model relating the network structure to observable prices. The financial network structure can be learned using CDS data. Conditional default probability and expected conditional loss can be calculated accordingly. As the information is extracted from the CDS price, all quantities are under the risk- neutral measure, and thus account for the market fear that can trigger bank run. This knowledge can be used to gauge systemic risk and inform policy decisions.},

Long-term effects of news are moreover inconsistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which maintains that new information gives immediately rise to a new equilibrium. The EMH is under discussion, however, as a result of the transformation of financial markets and of financial journalism due to new economic thoughts, new communication theories, high-frequency trading and high-frequency sentiment analysis. As a case study of a market panic we show the impact of US news, UK news and Dutch news on three Dutch banks during the financial crisis of 2007-9. To avoid market panics, financial journalists may strive for greater transparency, not only on asset prices and corporate philosophies, but also on network dependencies in the worldwide financial markets.},

The structural features revealed show bilateral CDS exposures describing growing scale- free networks whose highly interconnected hubs constitute both a strength and weakness for the stability of the system. The potential “super spreaders” of financial contagion, identified as the most interconnected participants, consist mostly of banks. For some of them net notional exposures may be particularly large relative to their total common equity.

Consistent with the predictions of Rajan (2006), we document that the largest mutual funds were more likely than the smaller ones to take “hidden tail risk” by selling CDS contracts. Additionally, we show that smaller funds exhibited herding behavior in which they followed leading funds in initiating the selling or speculative buying of CDS contracts on new reference entities. Moreover, the reference entities that attracted the most selling interest from the large mutual funds are disproportionately firms that were perceived to be “too large to fail” or “too systemic to fail.” Our combined evidence indicates that the use of CDS by mutual funds heightened the correlation in financial health among the systemically important financial institutions and contributed to the increased fragility of the financial system},

abstract = {Securitization is a financial innovation that experiences a boom-bust cycle, as many other innovations before. This paper analyzes possible reasons for the breakdown of primary and secondary securitization markets, and argues that misaligned incentives along the value chain are the primary cause of the problems. The illiquidity of asset and interbank markets, in this view, is a market failure derived from ill-designed mechanisms of coordinating financial intermediaries and investors. Thus, illiquidity is closely related to the design of the financial chains. Our policy conclusions emphasize crisis prevention rather than crisis management, and the objective is to restore a comprehensive incentive alignment. The toe-hold for strengthening regulation is surprisingly small. First, we emphasize the importance of equity piece retention for the long-term quality of the underlying asset pool. As a consequence, equity piece allocation needs to be publicly known, alleviating market pricing. Second, on a micro level, accountability of managers can be improved by compensation packages aiming at long term incentives, and penalizing policies with destabilizing effects on financial markets. Third, on a macro level, increased transparency relating to effective risk transfer, risk-related management compensation, and credible measurement of rating performance stabilizes the valuation of financial assets and, hence, improves the solvency of financial intermediaries. Fourth, financial intermediaries, whose risk is opaque, may be subjected to higher capital requirements.},

This also extends the network model of Feinstein (2015) which incorporates multiple illiquid assets with fire sales and no leverage ratios. We prove existence of equilibrium clearing payments and liquidation prices for a known liquidation strategy when leverage requirements are required. We also prove sufficient conditions for the existence of an equilibrium liquidation strategy with corresponding clearing payments and liquidation prices. Finally we calibrate network models to asset and liability data for 50 banks in the United States from 2007-2014 in order to draw conclusions on systemic risk as a function of leverage requirements.},

Tightness in the market for liquidity leads banks to engage in what we term "liquidity pull-back," which involves selling financial assets either by banks directly or by levered investors. Empirical tests on the stock market are supportive. Tighter interbank markets are associated with relatively more volume in more liquid stocks; selling pressure, especially in more liquid stocks; and transitory negative returns. We control for market-wide uncertainty and in the process also contribute to the literature on portfolio rebalancing.

We use a sample of virtually all US commercial banks during the period 1998-2010 to analyze the relationship between these two risk sources on the bank institutional-level and how this relationship influences banks' probabilities of default (PD). Our results show that both risk categories do not have an economically meaningful reciprocal contemporaneous or time-lagged relationship. However, they do influence banks' probability of default. This effect is twofold: whereas both risks separately increase the PD, the influence of their interaction depends on the overall level of bank risk and can either aggravate or mitigate default risk. These results provide new insights into the understanding of bank risk and serve as an underpinning for recent regulatory efforts aimed at strengthening banks (joint) risk management of liquidity and credit risks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The results show that banks with weaker structural liquidity and higher leverage in the pre-crisis period were more likely to fail afterward. The likelihood of bank failure also increases with bank risk-taking. In the cross-section, the smaller domestically-oriented banks were relatively more vulnerable to liquidity risk, while the large cross- border banks were more susceptible to solvency risk due to excessive leverage. The results support the proposed Basel III regulations on structural liquidity and leverage, but suggest that emphasis should be placed on the latter, particularly for the systemically-important institutions. Macroeconomic and monetary conditions are also shown to be related with the likelihood of bank failure, providing a case for the introduction of a macro-prudential approach to banking regulation.},

@article{Caccioli2014,
abstract = {Common asset holdings are widely believed to have been the primary vector of contagion in the recent financial crisis. We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify instabilities. The financial system exhibits “robust yet fragile” behavior, with regions of the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing.},

abstract = {Portfolio diversification makes investors individually safer but creates connections between them through common asset holdings. Such connections create "endogenous covariances" between assets and investors, and enhance systemic risk by propagating shocks swiftly through the system. We provide a theoretical model in which shocks spread through constrained selling from N diversified portfolio investors in a network of asset holdings with home bias, and study the desirability of diversification by comparing the multivariate distribution of implied losses for every level of diversification. There may be a region on the parameter set for which the propagation effect dominates the individually safer one. We derive analytically the general element of the covariance between two assets i and j. We find agents may minimize their exposure to endogenous risk by spreading their wealth across more and more distant assets. The resulting network enhances systemic stability. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Goyal2007,
abstract = {We consider a setting where every pair of players that undertake a transaction (e.g. exchange goods or information) creates a unit surplus. A transaction can take place only if the players involved have a connection. If the connection is direct the two players split the surplus equally, while if it is indirect then intermediate players also get an equal share of the surplus. Thus, individuals form links with others to create surplus, to gain intermediation rents, and to circumvent others who are trying to become intermediary. Our analysis clarifies the interplay between these forces in the process of strategic network formation. First, we show that, in the absence of capacity constraints on links, it leads to the emergence of a star network where a single agent acts as an intermediary for all transactions and enjoys significantly higher payoffs. Second, we study the implications of capacity constraints in the ability of agents to form links. In this case, distances between players must be long, which induces players who are "far off" to connect in order to avoid paying large intermediation rents. A cycle network then emerges, payoffs being equal across all players. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Because only safe debt commands a liquidity premium, banks with risky assets use risk management to maximize their capacity to include such debt in the capital structure.

It can be pointed out that: (i) a backbone of the credit channel emerges, where some links play a crucial role; (ii) big banks privilege long-term contracts; the "minimal spanning trees" (iii) disclose a highly hierarchical backbone, where the central positions are occupied by the largest banks, and emphasize (iv) a strong geographical characterization, while (v) the clusters of firms do not have specific common properties. Moreover, (vi) while larger firms have multiple lending in large, (vii) the demand for credit (long vs. short term debt and multi-credit lines) of firms with similar sizes is very heterogeneous.},

Tracking changes to statements of historical performance recorded at di¤erent points in time between 2007 and 2011, we {\ldots}nd that historical returns are routinely revised. These revisions are not merely random or corrections of earlier mistakes; they are partly forecastable by fund characteristics. Moreover, funds that revise their performance histories signi{\ldots}cantly and predictably underperform those that have never revised, suggesting that unreliable disclosures constitute a valuable source of information for current and potential investors. These results speak to current debates about mandatory disclosures by {\ldots}nancial institutions to market regulators.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the network structure of the credit default swap (CDS) market and its determinants, using a unique dataset of bilateral notional exposures on 642 financial and sovereign reference entities. We find that the CDS network is centred around 14 major dealers, exhibits a "small world" structure and a scale-free degree distribution. A large share of investors are net CDS buyers, implying that total credit risk exposure is fairly concentrated. Consistent with the theoretical literature on the use of CDS, the debt volume outstanding and its structure (maturity and collateralization), the CDS spread volatility and market beta, as well as the type (sovereign/financial) of the underlying bond are statistically significantly related-with expected signs-to structural characteristics of the CDS market. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Some have argued that recent increases in credit risk transfer are desirable because they improve the diversification of risk. Others have suggested that they may be undesirable if they increase the risk of financial crises. Using a model with banking and insurance sectors, we show that credit risk transfer can be beneficial when banks face uniform demand for liquidity. However, when they face idiosyncratic liquidity risk and hedge this risk in an interbank market, credit risk transfer can be detrimental to welfare. It can lead to contagion between the two sectors and increase the risk of crises. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using novel position and trading data for single-name corporate CDSs, we provide evidence that CDS markets emerge as “alternative trading venues” for hedging and speculation: CDS markets are larger and more likely to exist for firms with bonds that are fragmented into many separate issues—suggesting a standardization and liquidity role of CDS markets. While hedging motives are associated with comparable trading volume in the bond and CDS markets, speculative trading volume is concentrated in the CDS market. Finally, we document arbitrage activity that links the CDS and the bond market via the basis trade.},

abstract = {It was recently recognized that interdependencies among different networks can play a crucial role in triggering cascading failures and hence system-wide disasters. A recent model shows how pairs of interdependent networks can exhibit an abrupt percolation transition as failures accumulate. We report on the effects of topology on failure propagation for a model system consisting of two interdependent networks. We find that the internal node correlations in each of the two interdependent networks significantly changes the critical density of failures that triggers the total disruption of the two-network system. Specifically, we find that the assortativity (i.e. the likelihood of nodes with similar degree to be connected) within a single network decreases the robustness of the entire system. The results of this study on the influence of assortativity may provide insights into ways of improving the robustness of network architecture, and thus enhances the level of protection of critical infrastructures.},

We propose a statistical model to account for sparsity, formalizing the assignment of trade shipments to country, product, and firm categories as balls falling into bins. The balls-and-bins model quantitatively reproduces the pattern of zero product- and firm-level trade flows across export destinations, and the frequency of multiproduct, multidestination exporters. In contrast, balls-and-bins overpredicts the fraction of exporting firms. (JEL F11, F14)},

abstract = {Gephi is a network visualization software used in various disciplines (social network analysis, biology, genomics...). One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

abstract = {Under Basel III rules, banks become subject to a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) from 2015 onwards, to promote short-term resilience. We investigate the effects of such liquidity regulation on bank liquid assets and liabilities. Results indicate co-integration of liquid assets and liabilities, to maintain a minimum short-term liquidity buffer. Still, microprudential regulation has not prevented an aggregate liquidity cycle characterised by a pro-cyclical pattern in the size of balance sheets and risk taking. Our error correction regressions indicate that adjustment in the liquidity ratio is balanced towards the liability side, especially when the liquidity ratio is below its long-term equilibrium. This finding contrasts established wisdom that the LCR is mainly driven by changes in liquid assets. Policy implications focus on the need to complement microprudential regulation with a macroprudential approach. This involves monitoring of aggregate liquid assets and liabilities and addressing pro-cyclical behaviour by restricting leverage.},

abstract = {In September 2009, G20 paved the way for the mandatory central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which came into effect in December 2012. This new regulation involves a central clearing counterparty (CCP): a financial institution acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers of OTC derivatives. The rationale behind this regulation is that, by removing bilateral agreements, CCPs will absorb the risks facing individual firms and act as a cushion in the event of market stress. However, this increases the systemic importance of CCPs within the financial system. In this paper, we analyze the effect of central clearing of OTC derivatives on the financial system stability by means of network simulation approach. We build simple but realistic net- works of financial firms, connected by bilateral links and via a single CCP.We simulate balance sheets of firms and introduce shocks to the system to simulate defaults. The default mechanism and shock absorption in presence of the CCP is modeled in the way that maximally reflects the reality. We run Monte Carlo simulations of the networks' evolution and obtain their default and contagion characteristics. We analyze the likelihood of the CCP's default and compare the stability of the financial network with and without the CCP for various network configurations and market scenarios. We find that, for a homogeneous financial system, the presence of the CCP increases the network's stability; moreover, in this case the probability of the CCP's failure is virtually zero. However, for non-homogeneous financial networks (e.g., for so-called ”small world networks”), we find quite the opposite effects: the presence of the CCP leads to a disproportionately large probability of contagion defaults, especially for smaller financial firms, which are in fact sacri- ficed in order to keep large financial firms afloat. Furthermore, we find that the probability of the CCP failure is substantial in this case, regardless of the capitalization requirements. In all, we find that non-homogeneous networks exhibit greater instability and contagion in the presence of the CCP: a worrying fact, given that any real financial system is highly inhomogeneous in terms of size and concentration.},

abstract = {Cross-border equity and long-term debt securities portfolio investment networks are analysed from 2002 to 2012, covering the 2008 global financial crisis. They serve as network-proxies for measuring the robustness of the global financial system and the interdependence of financial markets, respectively. Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified: First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the global financial system. Second, using a phenomenological model, the edge density of the debt securities network is found to describe, and even forecast, the proliferation of several over-the-counter-traded financial derivatives, most prominently credit default swaps, enabling one to detect potentially dangerous levels of market interdependence and systemic risk.},

abstract = {We analyse time series of CDS spreads for a set of major US and European institutions in a period overlapping the recent financial crisis. We extend the existing methodology of $\epsilon$-drawdowns to the one of joint $\epsilon$-drawups, in order to estimate the conditional probabilities of spike-like co-movements among pairs of spreads. After correcting for randomness and finite size effects, we find that, depending on the period of time, 50{\%} of the pairs or more exhibit high probabilities of joint drawups and the majority of spread series are trend-reinforced, i.e. drawups tend to be followed by drawups in the same series. We then carry out a network analysis by taking the probability of joint drawups as a proxy of financial dependencies among institutions. We introduce two novel centrality-like measures that offer insights on how both the systemic impact of each node as well as its vulnerability to other nodes' shocks evolve in time.},

These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods, and seem to contain predictive power in out-of-sample tests. Our results show an asymmetry in the degree of connectedness among the four sectors, with banks playing a much more important role in transmitting shocks than other financial institutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

This suggests that the traditional tenet prescribing the separation between prudential regulation and monetary policy should be abandoned. We also show that failure to cut interest rates during a crisis erodes financial stability by increasing the risk of bank runs.},

Various microscopic processes have been incorporated in these models, among them, node and edge addition, vertex fitness and the deletion of nodes and edges. The existing models, however, focus on specific combinations of these processes and parameterize them in a way that makes it difficult to elucidate the role of the individual elementary mechanisms. We therefore formulated and solved a model that incorporates the minimal processes governing network evolution. Some contribute to growth such as the formation of connections between existing pair of vertices, while others capture deletion; the removal of a node with its corresponding edges, or the removal of an edge between a pair of vertices. We distinguish between these elementary mechanisms, identifying their specific role on network evolution.},

abstract = {Robust (cross-border) interbank markets are important for the well functioning of modern financial systems. Yet, a network of interbank exposures may lead to domino effects following the event of an initial bank failure. The structure of the interbank market is a potential important driving factor in the risk and impact of interbank contagion. We investigate the evolution of contagion risk for the Belgian banking system over the period 1993-2002 using detailed information on aggregate interbank exposures of individual banks and on large bilateral interbank exposures. We find that a change from a complete structure (where all banks have symmetric links) towards a multiple money centre structure (where the money centres are symmetrically linked to some banks, which are themselves not linked together) as well as a more concentrated banking market have decreased the risk and impact of contagion. Moreover, an increase in the proportion of cross-border interbank assets has lowered the risk and impact of local contagion. Yet, this reduction was probably accompanied by an increase in contagion risk generated by foreign banks, although even here the contagion risk appears fairly limited.},

@article{Admati2011,
abstract = {We examine the pervasive view that equity is expensive, which leads to claims that high capital requirements are costly and would affect credit markets adversely. We find that arguments made to support this view are either fallacious, irrelevant, or very weak. For example, the return on equity contains a risk premium that must go down if banks have more equity. It is thus incorrect to assume that the required return on equity remains fixed as capital requirements increase. It is also incorrect to translate higher taxes paid by banks to a social cost. Policies that subsidize debt and indirectly penalize equity through taxes and implicit guarantees are distortive. Any desirable public subsidies to banks activities should be given directly and not in ways that encourage leverage. Finally, suggestions that high leverage serves a necessary disciplining role are based on inadequate theory lacking empirical support. We conclude that bank equity is not socially expensive, and that high leverage is not necessary for banks to perform all their socially valuable functions, including lending, taking deposits and issuing money-like securities. To the contrary, better capitalized banks suffer fewer distortions in lending decisions and would perform better. The fact that banks choose high leverage does not imply that this is socially optimal, and, except for government subsidies and viewed from an ex ante perspective, high leverage may not even be privately optimal for banks. Setting equity requirements significantly higher than the levels currently proposed would entail large social benefits and minimal, if any, social costs. Approaches based on equity dominate alternatives, including contingent capital. To achieve better capitalization quickly and efficiently and prevent disruption to lending, regulators must actively control equity payouts and issuance. If remaining challenges are addressed, capital regulation can be a powerful tool for enhancing the role of banks in the economy.},

We provide a model of international contagion allowing for bank bailouts. While a social planner trades off tax distortions, liquidation losses, and intra- and intercountry income inequality, in the noncooperative game between governments there are inefficiencies due to externalities, a lack of burden sharing, and free riding. We show that, in absence of cooperation, stronger interbank linkages make government interests diverge, whereas cross-border asset holdings tend to align them. We analyze different forms of cooperation and their effects on global and national welfare. (JEL C72, G01, G21, G28)},

These gains were somewhat reduced by the concentration of bank subsidiaries in specific geographical regions, which is typical of the observed international expansion strategies.

The limited liability of banks and the presence of a negative externality of one bank's failure on the health of other banks give rise to a systemic risk-shifting incentive where all banks undertake correlated investments, thereby increasing economy-wide aggregate risk. Regulatory mechanisms such as bank closure policy and capital adequacy requirements that are commonly based only on a bank's own risk fail to mitigate aggregate risk-shifting incentives, and can, in fact, accentuate systemic risk. Prudential regulation is shown to operate at a collective level, regulating each bank as a function of both its joint (correlated) risk with other banks as well as its individual (bank-specific) risk.},

The evidence in this paper supports this view. The differ- ential effects across sectors are stronger in developing countries, in countries with less access to foreign finance, and where banking crises were more severe. Robustness checks include controlling for recessions, currency crises, and alternative proxies for bank dependence.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method to measure and monitor the risk in a banking system. Standard tools that regulators require banks to use for their internal risk management are applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk of a regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international banks from 1988 until 2002, 1 estimate the dynamics and correlations between bank asset portfolios. To obtain measures for the risk of a regulator's portfolio, I model the individual liabilities that the regulator has to each bank as contingent claims on the bank's assets. The portfolio aspect of the regulator's liability is explicitly considered and the methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital levels. In the sample period, the North American banking system gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by regulatory capital requirements.

abstract = {This paper shows that large economic downturns may result from the propagation of microeconomic shocks over the input-output linkages across different firms or sectors within the economy. Building on the framework of Acemoglu et al. (2012), we argue that the economy's input-output structure can fundamentally reshape the distribution of aggregate output, increasing the likelihood of large downturns from infinitesimal to substantial. More specifically, we show that an economy with non-trivial intersectoral input-output linkages that is subject to thin-tailed productivity shocks may exhibit deep recessions as frequently as economies that are subject to heavy-tailed shocks. Moreover, we show that in the presence of input-output linkages, aggregate volatility is not necessarily a sufficient statistic for the likelihood of large downturns. Rather, depending on the shape of the distribution of the idiosyncratic shocks, different features of the economy's input-output network may be of first-order importance. Finally, our results establish that the effects of the economy's input-output structure and the nature of the idiosyncratic firm-level shocks on aggregate output are not separable, in the sense that the likelihood of large economic downturns is determined by the interplay between the two.},

abstract = {The panic of 20072008 was a run on the sale and repurchase market (the repo market), which is a very large, short-term market that provides financing for a wide range of securitization activities and financial institutions. Repo transactions are collateralized, frequently with securitized bonds. We refer to the combination of securitization plus repo finance as securitized banking and argue that these activities were at the nexus of the crisis. We use a novel data set that includes credit spreads for hundreds of securitized bonds to trace the path of the crisis from subprime-housing related assets into markets that had no connection to housing. We find that changes in the LIB-OIS spread, a proxy for counterparty risk, were strongly correlated with changes in credit spreads and repo rates for securitized bonds. These changes implied higher uncertainty about bank solvency and lower values for repo collateral. Concerns about the liquidity of markets for the bonds used as collateral led to increases in repo haircuts, that is the amount of collateral required for any given transaction. With declining asset values and increasing haircuts, the US banking system was effectively insolvent for the first time since the Great Depression.},

When there is a lack of opportunities for banks to hedge idiosyncratic and aggregate liquidity shocks, the interbank market is characterized by excessive price volatility. In such a situation, a central bank can implement the constrained efficient allocation by using open market operations to fix the short term interest rate. It can be constrained efficient for banks to hoard liquidity and stop trading with each other if there is sufficient uncertainty about aggregate liquidity demand compared to idiosyncratic liquidity demand.},

And we suggest why the resilience of the system in withstanding fairly large shocks prior to 2007 should not have been taken as a reliable guide to its future robustness.},

We focus on conflicts between bank managers and owners over risk, and we show that bank risk taking varies positively with the comparative power of shareholders within the corporate governance structure of each bank. Moreover, we show that the relation between bank risk and capital regulations, deposit insurance policies, and restrictions on bank activities depends critically on each bank's ownership structure, such that the actual sign of the marginal effect of regulation on risk varies with ownership concentration. These findings show that the same regulation has different effects on bank risk taking depending on the bank's corporate governance structure.},

linkages can be fruitfully characterized using concepts borrowed from the theory of (complex) networks. This paper
critically surveys recent theoretical work that exploits this concept to explain the sources of contagion and systemic
risk in financial markets. We taxonomize existing contributions according to the impact of network connectivity, bank
heterogeneity, existing uncertainty in financial markets, portfolio composition of the banks. We end with a discussion
of the most important challenges faced by theoretical network-based models of systemic risk. These include a better
understanding of the causal links between network structure and the likelihood of systemic risk and increasingly using
the empirical knowledge about real-world financial-network structures to calibrate theoretical models.},

abstract = {As economic entities become increasingly interconnected, a shock in a financial network can provoke significant cascading failures throughout the system. To study the systemic risk of financial systems, we create a bi-partite banking network model composed of banks and bank assets and propose a cascading failure model to describe the risk propagation process during crises. We empirically test the model with 2007 US commercial banks balance sheet data and compare the model prediction of the failed banks with the real failed banks after 2007. We find that our model efficiently identifies a significant portion of the actual failed banks reported by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The results suggest that this model could be useful for systemic risk stress testing for financial systems. The model also identifies that commercial rather than residential real estate assets are major culprits for the failure of over 350 US commercial banks during 2008-2011.},

abstract = {This paper studies international diversification in banking, exploiting a bank-level dataset that covers the operations of 38 global banks and their subsidiaries overseas during 1995–2004. The paper finds that banks with a larger share of assets allocated to subsidiaries in emerging market countries were able to attain higher risk-adjusted returns. These gains were somewhat reduced by the concentration of bank subsidiaries in specific geographical regions, which is typical of the observed international expansion strategies. The paper also finds a substantial home bias in the international allocation of bank assets relative to the results of a mean–variance portfolio optimization model.},

We use this framework to study various market frictions that can result in excessive in- terconnectedness that was seen during the crisis. In this paper, we focus on two channels that arises from regulatory intervention - deposit insurance and the too big to fail problem.},

It has become even rare to make a contract without collateral agreement among the major financial institutions. In addition to the significant reduction of the counterparty exposure, collateralization has important implications for the pricing of derivatives through the change of effective funding cost. This paper has demonstrated the impact of collateralization on the derivative pricing by constructing the term structure of swap rates based on the actual market data. It has also shown the importance of the ”choice” of collateral currency. Especially, when the contract allows multiple currencies as eligible collateral and free replacement among them, the paper has found that the embedded ”cheapest-to-deliver” option can be quite valuable and significantly change the fair value of a trade. The implications of these findings for market risk management have been also discussed.},

This risk is measured by losses to the financial system that may result via the OTC derivative contracts from the default of one or more banks or primary broker-dealers. We then stress the importance of “netting” within the OTC derivative contracts. Our methodology shows that, even using data from before the worsening of the crisis in late Summer 2008, the potential cascade effects could be very substantial. We summarize our results in the context of the stability of the banking system and provide some policy measures that could be usefully considered by the regulators in their discussions of current issues.

For such regulation to be effective in controlling the aggregate supply of credit: (i) changes in capital requirements need to affect loan supply by regulated banks, and (ii) substitute sources of credit should not fully offset changes in credit supply by affected banks. This paper examines micro evidence — lacking to date — on both questions, using a unique data set. In the United Kingdom, regulators have imposed time-varying, bank-specific minimum capital requirements since Basel I. Over the 1998–2007 period, UK-regulated banks reduced lending in response to tighter capital requirements. But non UK-regulated banks (resident foreign branches) increased lending in response to tighter capital requirements on a relevant reference group of regulated banks. This ‘leakage' was material although only partial: it offset — by about one third — the initial impulse from the regulatory change. These results suggest that, on balance, changes in capital requirements can have a substantial impact on aggregate credit supply by UK-resident banks.

Optimal approximations depend upon the details of the time series representation that generates the data. Fortunately, for U.S. macroeconomic data, getting the details exactly right is not crucial. A simple approach, based on the generally false assumption that the data are generated by a random walk, is nearly optimal. We use the tools discussed here to document a new fact: There has been a significant shift in the money2013inflation relationship before and after 1960.},

abstract = {Modern risk management calls for an understanding of stochastic de- pendence going beyond simple linear correlation. This paper deals with the static (non-time-dependent) case and emphasizes the copula representation of depen- dence for a random vector. Linear correlation is a natural dependence measure for multivariate normally and, more generally, elliptically distributed risks but other dependence concepts like comonotonicity and rank correlation should also be understood by the risk management practitioner. Using counterexamples the falsity of some commonly held views on correlation is demonstrated; in general, these fallacies arise from the naive assumption that dependence properties of the elliptical world also hold in the non-elliptical world. In particular, the problem of finding multivariate models which are consistent with prespecified marginal dis- tributions and correlations is addressed. Pitfalls are highlighted and simulation algorithms avoiding these problems are constructed.},

We begin by observing that when cash flows depend on current economic conditions, there will be a benefit for firms to adapt their default and financing policies to the position of the economy in the business cycle phase. We then demonstrate that this simple observation has a wide range of empirical implications for corporations. Notably, we show that our model can replicate observed debt levels and the countercyclicality of leverage ratios. We also demonstrate that it can reproduce the observed term structure of credit spreads and generate strictly positive credit spreads for debt contracts with very short maturities. Finally, we characterize the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the pace and size of capital structure changes, and debt capacity.},

Using "extreme value theory" to model the multivariate distribution tails, we derive the distribution of extreme correlation for a wide class of return distributions. Empirically, we reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality for the negative tail, but not for the positive tail. We also find that correlation is not related to market volatility per se but to the market trend. Correlation increases in bear markets, but not in bull markets.},

@article{Koopman2003,
abstract = {Various economic theories are available to explain the existence of credit and default cycles. There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macroeconomic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933-1997 US data on real GDP, credit spreads and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit and business cycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, corresponding to periods of around 6 and 11-16 years, respectively. Cyclical co-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at the longer frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicality is less clear-cut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive and negative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. This pattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World War 11 period. We comment on the implications of our findings for credit risk management. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley V Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Kole2007,
abstract = {Copulas offer financial risk managers a powerful tool to model the dependence between the different elements of a portfolio and are preferable to the traditional, correlation-based approach. In this paper, we show the importance of selecting an accurate copula for risk management. We extend standard goodness-of-fit tests to copulas. Contrary to existing, indirect tests, these tests can be applied to any copula of any dimension and are based on a direct comparison of a given copula with observed data. For a portfolio consisting of stocks, bonds and real estate, these tests provide clear evidence in favor of the Student's t copula, and reject both the correlation-based Gaussian copula and the extreme value-based Gumbel copula. In comparison with the Student's t copula, we find that the Gaussian copula underestimates the probability of joint extreme downward movements, while the Gumbel copula overestimates this risk. Similarly we establish that the Gaussian copula is too optimistic on diversification benefits, while the Gumbel copula is too pessimistic. Moreover, these differences are significant.

abstract = {To what extent do national borders and national currencies impose costs that segment markets across countries? To answer this question we use a dataset with product level retail prices and wholesale costs for a large grocery chain with stores in the U.S. and Canada. We develop a model of pricing by location and employ a regression discontinuity approach to estimate and interpret the border effect. We report three main facts: 1) The median absolute retail price and whole-sale cost discontinuity between adjacent stores on either side of the U.S.-Canada border is as high as 21{\%}. In contrast, within-country border discontinuity is close to 0{\%}; 2) The variation in the retail price gap at the border is almost entirely driven by variation in wholesale costs, not by variation in markups; 3) The border gap in prices and costs co-move almost one to one with changes in the U.S.-Canada nominal exchange rate. We show these facts suggest that the price gaps we estimate provide only a lower bound on border costs.},

Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

At the same time, they may represent a channel for contagion as a bank default may spread to other banks through interbank linkages. This paper analyses how contagion propagates within the Italian interbank market using a unique data set including actual bilateral exposures. Based on the availability of information on actual bilateral exposures for all Italian banks, the results obtained by assuming the maximum entropy are compared with those reflecting the observed structure of interbank claims. The comparison indicates that, under certain circumstances, depending on the structure of the interbank linkages, the recovery rates of interbank exposures and banks' capitalisation, the maximum entropy approach overrates the scope for contagion.},

abstract = {Under the new Capital Accord, banks choose between two different types of risk management systems, the standard or the internal rating based approach. The paper considers how a bank's preference for a risk management system is affected by the presence of supervision by bank regulators. The model uses a principal–agent setting between a bank's owner and its risk management. The main conclusion is that previously unregulated institutions can be expected to switch to the lower quality standard approach subsequent to becoming regulated, i.e., the presence of regulation may induce a bank to decrease the quality of its risk management system.},

abstract = {Banks are linked through the interbank deposit market, participations like syndicated loans and deposit interest rate risk. The similarity in exposures carries the potential for systemic breakdowns. This potential is either strong or weak, depending on whether the linkages remain or vanish asymptotically. It is shown that the linearity of the bank portfolios in the exposures, in combination with a condition on the tails of the marginal distributions of these exposures, determines whether the potential for systemic risk is weak or strong. We show that if the exposures have marginal normal distributions the potential for systemic risk is weak, while if e.g. the Student distributions apply the potential is strong.},

abstract = {While the too-big-to-fail guarantee is explicitly a part of bank regulation in many countries, this paper shows that bank closure policies also suffer from an implicit “too-many-to-fail” problem: when the number of bank failures is large, the regulator finds it ex-post optimal to bail out some or all failed banks, whereas when the number of bank failures is small, failed banks can be acquired by the surviving banks. This gives banks incentives to herd and increases the risk that many banks may fail together. The ex-post optimal regulation may thus be time-inconsistent or sub-optimal from an ex-ante standpoint. In contrast to the too-big-to-fail problem which mainly affects large banks, we show that the too-many-to-fail problem affects small banks more by giving them stronger incentives to herd.},

abstract = {A main cause of the crisis of 2007–2009 is the various ways through which banks have transferred credit risk in the financial system. We study the systematic risk of banks before the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation, which has typically focused on individual institutions.},

abstract = {Researchers increasingly turn to counterfactual simulations to estimate the danger of contagion owing to exposures in the interbank loan market. This paper summarises the findings of such simulations, provides a critical assessment of the modelling assumptions on which they are based, and discusses their use in financial stability analysis. On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. Robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify banks whose failure could give rise to contagion. They are, however, less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations.},

This might lead to fi- nancial instability if national authorities do not internalise externalities abroad.

We estimate the costs and benefits of financial stability support for large, internationally active banks under several proposed agreements. We show costs according to the ‘national solution', where only home authorities inject capital, as our benchmark. ‘Specific' sharing agree- ments would be redistributive at the expense of smaller and East European countries (not home to large cross-border banking groups). The ‘general fund' mechanism will smooth costs across countries but may lead to unequal redistribution of costs. We also show that coordinating bank failure costs may bring about financial stability benefits},

We study both how the reserve levels accumulated earlier in a maintenance period influence the morning level of the funds rate relative to the target set by the FOMC, and how same-day reserve levels as well as the reserve levels accumulated earlier affect intraday movements of the funds rate. The impact of recurring calendar events on the behavior of the federal funds rate is also explored. In general, we find a negative relationship between our measures of reserve levels and our two measures of federal funds rate behavior.},

Two competing theories explain the observed patterns: private information about future security prices and trading stoppages. The Federal funds market allows a unique opportunity to study the causes of intraday patterns because private information common to most markets does not play a role in setting prices. We find reverse-J variance patterns while accounting for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model effects. Our results support trading stops as an explanation for the reverse-J pattern and suggest that private information is not a necessary condition for the observed pattern.},

@article{Rufibach2011a,
abstract = {Publication bias, the fact that studies identified for inclusion in a meta analysis do not represent all studies on the topic of interest, is commonly recognized as a threat to the validity of a meta analysis. One way to explicitly model publication bias is via weighted probability distributions. We adopt the non-parametric approach initially introduced by Dear and Begg (1992) but impose that the weight function w is monotonely non-increasing as a function of the p-value. Since in meta analysis one typically only has few studies or "observations," regularization of the estimation problem seems sensible. In addition, virtually all parametric weight functions proposed so far in the literature are in fact decreasing. We discuss how to estimate a decreasing weight function in the above model and illustrate the new methodology on two well-known examples. Some basic properties of the log-likelihood function and computation of a p-value quantifying the evidence against the null hypothesis of a constant weight function are indicated. In addition, we provide an approximate selection bias adjusted profile likelihood confidence interval for the treatment effect. The corresponding software and the data sets used to illustrate it are provided as the R package selectMeta (Rufibach, 2011).},

abstract = {This paper studies banks'incentives to engage in liquidity cross-insurance. In contrast to previous literature we view interbank insurance as the outcome of bilateral (and non- exclusive) contracting between pairs of banks and ask whether this outcome is socially e¢ cient. Using a simple model of interbank insurance we {\ldots}nd that this is indeed the case when insurance takes place through pure transfers. This is even though liquidity support among banks sometimes breaks down, as observed in the crisis of 2007-2008. However, when insurance is provided against some form of repayment (such as is the case, for exam- ple, with credit lines), banks have a tendency to insure each other less than the socially e¢ cient amount. We show that e¢ ciency can be restored by introducing seniority clauses for interbank claims or through subsidies that resemble government interbank lending guar- antees. Interestingly, even considering generic externalities among banks we {\ldots}nd that there cannot be situations where banks insure more than is e¢ cient. Such insurance, however, may arise if banks receive regulatory subsidies (explicit or implicit) in case they fail jointly.},

abstract = {
Large banking groups face the question of how to optimally allocate and generate liquidity: in a central liquidity hub or in many decentralized branches. We translate this question into a facility location problem under uncertainty. We show that volatility is the key driver behind (de-)centralization. We provide an analytical solution for the 2-branch model and show that a liquidity center can be interpreted as an option on immediate liquidity. Therefore, its value can be interpreted as the price of information, i.e., the price of knowing the exact demand. Furthermore, we derive the threshold above which it is advantageous to open a liquidity center and show that it is a function of the volatility and the characteristic of the bank network. Finally, we discuss the n-branch model for real-world banking groups (10-60 branches) and show that it can be solved with high granularity (100 scenarios) within less than 30�s.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to provide evidence for how business group firms transfer financial resources among affiliated firms by examining the differences in the level of debt financing and the choices of new equity financing between group affiliated and non-affiliated firms in an emerging market, Turkey. The role of affiliated banks for internal capital market transactions is also to be examined. Design/methodology/approach – Univarite analysis and simple pooled OLS regression analysis are performed to examine the role of group affiliation on the level of several debt financing measures. Additionally, a Logit regression analysis is used to analyze the behavior of affiliated firms in their equity financing decisions by issuing new shares. Findings – Group affiliated firms transfer funds in the group by using transactions such as trade debt, and issuing cash rights and bonus shares. The affiliated firms – especially with a bank in the group – support their higher growth with new equity issues in the forms of cash rights and bonus shares along with higher trade debt. Moreover, non-affiliated firms utilize a higher percentage of debt to shareholders, while affiliated firms without a bank utilize a higher financial debt. These findings are consistent with the idea that the role of the group bank is very important in financing choices of affiliated firms. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides direct measures of external and internal funds by focusing on new equity issues and debt structure, which can be applied in different economic environments, rather than using indirect measures or not readily available datasets such as connected party transactions. Originality/value – The paper provides additional evidence to assess the efficiency of the use of internal capital markets. Moreover, the role of group affiliated banks among affiliated firms has not yet been extensively addressed in the literature and an examination of this is},

abstract = {The extent to which conglomerates face frictions in external capital markets has implications for their internal capital allocation. We find that, during recessions, when external financing costs are higher, conglomerates improve the efficiency of internal capital markets by increasing the allocation of funds to high q divisions relative to low q divisions. The improvement is significantly higher for conglomerates that are likely to face more binding financial constraints. This evidence suggests that although financial constraints impair managers' ability to undertake positive net present value projects, they improve the quality of project selection by reducing free cash flow and pressuring managers to fund the more valuable investment opportunities. It is consistent with theories stressing the benefits of internal capital markets in the presence of external capital market imperfections.},

abstract = {This paper examines how the onset of a financial crisis affects the operation of internal capital markets among firms within a diversified business group. We find that active internal capital markets within Korean business groups (chaebols) attenuate the financial constraints of the group-affiliated firms, allowing them to make efficient capital allocations during the early 1990s. However, these markets barely function after the financial crisis of 1997. Instead, we observe public debt markets serving as a substitute for internal capital markets. Our results suggest that chaebol firms' coordinated attempts to achieve healthier financial structures in the wake of the crisis have taken place at the expense of investment efficiency.},

The outbreak of the financial crisis coincided with a sharp increase of worldwide interbank interest rates. We analyze the micro and macroeconomic determinants of this phenomenon, finding that before August 2007 interbank rates were insensitive to borrower characteristics, whereas afterwards they became reactive to borrowers' creditworthiness. At the same time, conditions for large borrowers became relatively more favorable, both before and after the failure of Lehman Brothers. This suggests that banks have become more discerning in their lending, a welcome change, but that moral hazard considerations related to the ”too big to fail” argument should remain a main concern for central banks. },

currencies relative to the Deutsche mark, for the period March 1979-April
1992. Both the 'simplest test' and the 'drift adjustment' method
are used. The simplest test adjusts interest rate differentials for
the maximum and minimum expected rate of depreciation within the
exchange rate band; the drift-adjustment method adjusts interest
rate differentials by the estimated expected rate of depreciation
within the band. The latter method gives more precise estimates,
especially for short horizons, and allows statistical inference and
hypothesis testing. Expected rates of devaluation have generally
fallen during the period. Still, some devaluation expectations relative
to the Deutsche mark remain in 1992, except for the Belgian/Luxembourg
franc and the Netherlands guilder. Expected.rates of devaluation
have fluctuated more than interest rate differentials},

tax rates. Politicians are assumed to have the objective of maximising
expected votes. Their opinions regarding the level of tax rates reflect
their beliefs about the political cost (expected loss in votes) associated
with the tax rate, and also their attitudes towards taxation in general.
The authors present a test aimed at identifying relevant determinants
of both politicians' beliefs and attitudes. An analysis of politicians'
opinions allows them to test indirectly some central hypotheses of
tax choice models. Using a sample of 683 Flemish local politicians,
the authors have undertaken an ordered probit analysis of opinions
on the level of local income and local property taxes. The actual
level of taxation, the ideological position of the respondent, and
membership of the incumbent or opposition party affect opinions about
the level of both taxes. They find evidence that tax policy in neighboring
jurisdictions affects the perceived political cost of one's own property
tax rate. For opinions on the level of local income tax rates, the
ideological position of the electorate and interest group activity
are relevant determinants.},

abstract = {European banking regulation has been harmonized to a high degree over
the last few decades. Nevertheless, the European banking industry
remains fragmented as shown by the relatively high market shares
of banks in their home countries. In this paper we concentrate on
the integration process of European bank share prices. We develop
a parsimonious model that is able to detect different integration
(correlation) regimes. The model is applied to a set of 41 European
banks that have a continuous share price listing over the period
January 1990 ? March 2003. Our main finding is that the correlation
between larger banks in Europe has increased substantially over this
period, whereas the correlation between smaller banks has become
lower. A reason for this result could be that investors perceive
that the activities of bigger banks get more integrated. Another
reason may be that as a result of institutional and other larger
investors turning their investment strategies towards a European
sector-based approach, investors are tracking indices of the European
banking sector. These indices are typically constructed from the
stock prices of the larger banks. This would create an incentive
for large banks to become more integrated with other large banks},

1 January 1999 choices of irrevocably fixed conversion rates between
the Euro and the currencies of EMU members states. Current EU legislation,
notably the Maastricht treaty, requires that the bilateral currency
conversion factors implied by the 1 January 1999 choices equal closing
market exchange rates on 31 December 1998. Given that legal constraint,
there still exist several strategies for choosing the relative prices
of EMU member currencies against the Euro. Unfortunately, most of
these have potentially damaging side effects. One approach, based
on official Stage 2 offers of contingent Euro forward contracts with
value dates at the start of Stage 3, allows a highly credible preannouncement
of the bilateral currency conversion factors to be set at the start
of EMU. That approach assumes, however, that no prospective EMU members
can withdraw between their selection in May 1998 and the start of
Stage 3.},

abstract = {Abstract: Financial system stability is defined in terms of the expected
macroeconomic losses that arise from financial system disturbances.
This captures both the probability of various financial disturbances
and the size of the macroeconomic costs arising from such disturbances.
Because of the links between the real sector of the economy and the
financial sector, monetary policy needs to be cognisant of the potential
for financial system stability. We develop a general framework for
policy analysis which highlights the trade- off between financial
system stability and efficiency. We use this framework to analyse
the potential impact on stability and efficiency of three current
pressures in the Australian financial system. Namely, consolidation
among the largest banks, the formation of large financial conglomerates,
and greater opportunities for smaller niche institutions provided
by technological developments. We develop a simple model to show
that consolidation might reduce system stability through a loss of
diversification - which is important in the case of idiosyncratic
shocks to individual financial institutions. Offsetting this effect,
consolidation might increase system stability if contagion is an
important source of failure of financial institutions. Conglomeration
has two offsetting effects in terms of system stability: diversification
across different financial services can reduce the probability of
failure of an individual institution; and contamination, which can
lead to contagion flowing from failure of an unhealthy arm of the
conglomerate. JEL Codes: E58 G28 Keywords: financial system stability

abstract = {This paper explains inflation performance in a sample of 47 industrial
and transition economies during 1993.96 by looking at the incentives
that policymakers have to inflate the economy and at the perceived
costs of disinflation. After a brief literature review, panel-data
econometric techniques are used to estimate the effect on inflation
of several nonmonetary variables (such as the fiscal balance, the
degree of development of the government securities market, and the
unemployment rate) as well as a number of factors that may potentially
affect the natural rate of unemployment, particularly in transition
economies (such as the private sector share in GDP, price liberalization,
and trade liberalization). It also looks at some standard institutional
devices to lower inflation, such as central bank independence and
exchange rate pegging. The econometric results indicate a significant
effect of fiscal deficits on inflation, particularly (but not exclusively)
in countries where the government securities market is not well developed.
Other factors with a significant effect on inflation include relative
price changes, central bank independence, the exchange rate regime,
and the degree of price liberalization. There is only limited evidence
that other structural factors, such as those influencing the natural
rate of unemployment (and hence the .unemployment motive. for inflation),
affect inflation performance. The degree of openness of the economy
is also not significant, although this may reflect the inclusion
in the sample of many of the countries that were formerly part of
the Soviet Union.},

to learn why wages and salaries declined in only a few firms. Employers
were reluctant to cut pay because they believed doing so would hurt
employee morale, leading to lower productivity and current or future
difficulties with hiring and retention. It was thought that these
effects would in the end cost more than the savings from lower pay.
There were few indications that unemployed people had excessive wage
expectations. On the contrary, many unemployed were too flexible
and found themselves rejected by firms as overqualified. In most
companies, pay cuts were not a useful alternative to layoffs, because
pay cuts would not make it worthwhile to retain many employees and
because layoffs harmed morale less than would pay cuts. The findings
support none of the theories of wage rigidity except those of Solow
and Akerlof that emphasize morale.},

@article{Berkowitz2001,
abstract = {The forecast evaluation literature has traditionally focused on methods
of assessing point forecasts. However, in the context of many models
of financial risk, interest centers on more than just a single point
of the forecast distribution. For example, value-at-risk models that
are currently in extremely wide use form interval forecasts. Many
other important financial calculations also involve estimates not
summarized by a point forecast. Although some techniques are currently
available for assessing interval and density forecasts, existing
methods tend to display low power in sample sizes typically available.
This article suggests a new approach to evaluating such forecasts.
It requires evaluation of the entire forecast distribution, rather
than a scalar or interval. The information content of forecast distributions
combined with ex post realizations is enough to construct a powerful
test even with sample sizes as small as 100.},

and therefore, various interpretations can be attributed to it. We
start with the basic ARCH models and discuss their different interpretations.
ARCH models have been generalized in different directions to accommodate
more and more features of the real world. We provide a comprehensive
treatment of many of the extensions of the original ARCH model. Next
we discuss estimation and testing for ARCH models and note that these
models lead to some interesting and unique problems. There have been
numerous applications and we mention some of these as we present
different models. The paper includes a glossary of the acronyms for

The costs of disinflation are measured through {\#}sacrifice{\#}{\#}ratios{\#}

reduction in the inflation rate. The benefits of disinflation are
calculated by Robert Barro (1995), who estimates the growth benefits
from lower inflation. Ball's estimates are theoretically objectionable
and shown to be very fragile to minor changes in technique, but worthy
of study because of the interest they have elicited. Despite the
uncertainty associated with Ball's sacrifice ratio estimates and
Barro's growth estimates, relating them does permit us to obtain
a rough measure of the net cost of disinflation. Our findings indicate
that, contrary to popular opinion, disinflation probably produces
a net benefit, not a net cost and the output losses associated with
a typical U.S. disinflation are likely made up in 10-20 years --
less than one generation.},

market discipline reduces the benefits of conglomeration. With ineffective
market discipline of stand-alone activities, conglomeration would
further undermine market discipline, but may nevertheless be beneficial.
In particular, when rents are not too high, the diversification benefits
of conglomeration dominate the negative incentive effects. A more
competitive environment therefore induces conglomeration. We also
show that introducing internal cost-of-capital allocation schemes
creates internal market discipline that complements the weak external
market discipline of a conglomerate. Our analysis sheds light on

abstract = {Does the adoption of an inflation target by a country have an effect
on that country's rate of inflation and on inflation's interaction
with real economic variables? Does inflation targeting alter private-sector
expectations? The question of effectiveness must be posed as a counterfactual
- did target adopting countries find economic benefits they would
not have found had they not targeted? We offer three sets of measurements
of the effect of inflation targeting: the first concerning whether
the disinflation has been acheived at lower cost, or whether inflation
has come down in targeters to a greater extent than we would attribute
to normal cyclical factors; second, concerning whether the interactions
between inflation, monetary policy, and real variables have changed;
and the third concerning whether private-sector inflation expectations
have come down after targeting beyond that usually associated with
a drop in inflation. We consider the performance of New Zealand,
Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden on these measures versus three
baselines: their own past patterns prior to adoption; the performance
of similar countries, Italy and Australia, which did not adopt targets;
and the performance of two nominal targeters of long-standing, Germany
and Switzerland, over the same period. We find that inflation targeting
has had measurable effects on expectations and on the course of short-term
interest rates, but that sacrifice ratios and Phillips curves remain
unchanged in targeting countries.},

might have a useful role in monetary policy. We argue that it can,
but success depends critically on defining NAIRU as a short-run concept
and distinguishing it from a long-run concept like the natural rate
of unemployment. We examine what effect uncertainty has on the use
of NAIRU in policy. Uncertainty about the level of NAIRU does not
imply that monetary policy should react less to the NAIRU gap. However,
uncertainty about the effect of the NAIRU gap on inflation does require
adjustments to the policy reaction function. Also, as in Brainard
(1967), uncertainty about the effect of the monetary policy instrument
on the NAIRU gap reduces the magnitude of the policy response. We
estimate a simple NAIRU gap model for the United States to obtain
quantitative measures of uncertainty and to assess how these measures
affect our view of the policy reaction function.},

abstract = {The relative wealth hypothesis of Froot and Stein (1991), motivated
by the aggregate correlation between real exchange rates and foreign
direct investment (FDI) observed in the 1980s, cannot explain one
of the major shifts in FDI in the 1990s: the continued decline in
Japanese FDI during a period of stable stock prices and a rapidly
appreciating yen. However, when the relative wealth hypothesis is
supplemented with the relative access to credit hypothesis proposed
in this study, we are able to show that unequal access to credit
by Japanese firms can explain the FDI puzzle in the 1990s. We utilize
a unique data set that links individual Japanese firms engaged in
FDI to their main banks. Using both bank-level and firm-level data
sets, we find that financial difficulties at banks were economically
and statistically important in reducing the number of FDI projects
by Japanese firms into the United States, even after controlling
for the effects associated with the relative wealth movements driven
by macroeconomic fluctuations in the exchange rate and stock market
prices. This provides strong empirical evidence that differences
across firms in the degree of their access to credit can be an important
determinant of foreign direct investment.},

extension in the United States between 1987 and 1991 are simultaneously
modelled. Overall the results indicate that capital strength, commercial
and industrial loan growth and assets composition were important
factors in determining foreign banks' return-on-assets in the period
under study. Capital strength stands out as being the most important
factor influencing foreign bank return on shareholders equity. US
demand also appeared to be important in determining foreign bank
performance but it had no significant impact on growth in commercial
lending. There is also little evidence to suggest that the largest
foreign banks are significantly more profitable than their smaller
counterparts. In general, it appears that capital strength will be
one of the most important factors determining foreign bank performance
in the United States over the coming years. As a consequence, we
tentatively suggest that capital considerations may well outweigh
other factors when foreign bank expansion plans are considered in
the United States especially in the light of the 1997 nationwide
branch banking deregulation.},

abstract = {Procedures for assessing financial risk exposure, such as Value at
Risk, involve predicting the tail of the probability distribution
of asset value or return. Many techniques are in use, but a very
common strategy is to postulate a particular form for the distribution,
such as normal, estimate the standard deviation (and other parameters,
if necessary) from recent historical data, and compute where the
tail of the distribution corresponding to the specified horizon would
fall with that standard deviation. But this standard procedure does
not take account of the estimation error in the calculation, which
we find to be substantial even under the best of conditions. In practice,
a {\#}tail{\#}{\#}event{\#} may represent a truly rare occurrence, or it may
simply be a not-so-rare occurrence at a time when the predicted volatility
is an underestimate of the true volatility due to sampling error.
This problem becomes more serious the further n the tail one is trying
to predict.},

starting at high levels in the late nineteenth century, collapsing
between the wars, and recovering gradually after 1945 to reach levels
comparable to pre-1914 in the 1990's. The empirical evidence we survey
suggests that in some respects the financial integration of the pre-1914
era remains unsurpassed, but in others today's financial markets
are even more closely integrated than those in the past. The difference
today is that new information-generating and processing technologies
have reduced the market-segmenting effects of asymmetric information.
In consequence, the range of financial claims that are traded internationally
has broadened. While international financial transactions were once
determined by claims on governments, railroads, and mining companies,
entities with tangible and therefore relatively transparent assets,
international investors now transact freely in a much broader range
of securities.},

of time-consistent monetary policy. It suggests that this problem
originates in the assumption that agents have rational expectations

allow the monetary authority to build credibility for a disinflationary
policy by demonstrating that it will stick to that policy even if
it imposes short-run costs on the economy. Starting with these restrictions,
the paper derives conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of the
model's steady state; monetary policy in this unique steady state
involves the constant deflation advocated by Milton Friedman.},

abstract = {We investigate how the better integration of U.S. banks across states
has affected economic volatility within states. In theory, the link
between bank integration and volatility is ambiguous; integration
tends to dampen the impact of bank capital shocks on state activity,
but it amplifies the impact of firm collateral shocks. Empirically,
the net effect has been stabilizing as year-to-year fluctuations
in employment growth within states fall as that state's banks become
better integrated (via holding companies) with banks in other states.
The magnitudes are large, and the effects are most pronounced in
states with relatively undiversified economies. Consistent with our
model, we find the link between economic growth and bank capital
within a state weakens with integration, whereas the link between
growth and housing prices (a possible proxy for firm capital) tends
to increase.},

are found to be relatively attractive to international non-bank depositors.
Schemes characterized by co-insurance, a private administration,
and a low deposit insurance premium appear to be particularly favoured
by these depositors. The sensitivity of non-bank deposits to deposit
insurance policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory
competition in this area. The EU directive on deposit insurance imposes
minimum standards on national deposit insurance policies. This directive,
however, is silent on several important features of deposit insurance
such as the level of the deposit insurance premium. Hence, it may
not preclude regulatory competition in Europe},

to recent changes in the U.S. wage distribution. Relative distribution
methods are a nonparametric statistical framework for analyzing data
in a fully distributional context. The framework combines the graphical
tools of exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries, decomposition,
and inference. The relative distribution is similar to a density
ratio. It is technically defined as the random variable obtained
by transforming a variable from a comparison group by the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of that variable for a reference group.
This transformation produces a set of observations, the relative
data, that represent the rank of the original comparison value in
terms of the reference group's CDF. The density and CDF of the relative
data can therefore be used to fully represent and analyze distributional
differences. Analysis can move beyond comparisons of means and variances
to tap the detailed information inherent in distributions. The analytic
framework is general and flexible, as the relative density is decomposable
into the effect of location and shape differences, and into effects
that represent both compositional changes in covariates, and changes
in the covariate-outcome variable relationship.},

by putting a lower value on the equity of multinational corporations

the multinational discount is estimated to be in the range of 8.6{\%}

asset channel in which multinationals have disproportionately high
levels of assets in relation to the earnings they generate. Foreign
assets are particularly associated with value destruction. In contrast,
exporting from U.S. operations is associated with an export premium--of
approximately 3.9{\%}--resulting from both a higher market value and
a lower asset size. Given these findings, we ask why firms become
multinationals. Evidence reveals that the portion of a firm owned
by management is inversely related to the likelihood that the firm
is a multinational, so we conclude that managers who do not own much

troubled banks in light of rescue offers. A puzzling feature of experience
with banking crises is that in many cases policy authorities make
offers of bank rescue, and banks are reluctant to accept these offers.
We study situations in which regulators have decided to offer bank
rescue plans, and we show that a combination of factors, including
bankers' reputational concerns can explain banks' potential reluctance
to accept offers of recapitalisation.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the choice between inflation targeting and monetary
targeting as a strategy for the Eurosystem, the actual strategy the
Eurosystem announced in the fall of 1998, the framework for policy
decisions appropriate for achieving the goals of the Eurosystem,
the role of exchange rate management in the EMU, and the accountability
and transparency of the Eurosystem. The choice between inflation
targeting and monetary targeting is, in effect, a choice between
high and low transparency. Inflation targeting and monetary targeting,
in practice, imply similar policy decisions, but monetary targeting
implies that policy decisions are explained in terms of money-growth
developments that are not essential for policy. The Eurosystem has
specified an operational inflation target, although in a somewhat
ambiguous way. More importantly, its announced monetary strategy
is deficient, since it proposes a prominent role for an essentially
irrelevant money-growth indicator in analysis and communication,
but will keep secret the inflation forecast that will, in practice,
be the decisive input in policy decisions. Exchange rate policy is
controlled by the Council of finance ministers in the EMU; this is
a major inconsistency in the Maastricht Treaty and a possible threat
to the independence of the Eurosystem. The European Parliament may
have a crucial role in ensuring the accountability of the Eurosystem;
the minimum transparency needed for effective outside monitoring
and evaluation of the Eurosystem's policy decisions seem to require
published inflation forecasts and, most likely, published minutes
and voting records of the Governing Council.},

the determination of monetary policy in the context of a capital-theoretic,

of an institutional arrangement, there is a continuum of steady state
equilibria indexed by rates of inflation ranging from zero to infinity.
The social optimum is associated with zero inflation. We consider
three institutional arrangements for determining monetary policy.
The first, unconditional majority voting, always leads to a substantial
inflation bias, and can lead to the worst social outcome. The second,
a simple form of bargaining which we interpret as a policy board,
can improve on the unconditional majority voting outcome provided
capital share is sufficiently low. If this condition is not met,
the policy board design leaves the economy without a steady state
equilibrium. Finally, we consider a form of constitutional rule that
always achieves the social optimum.},

@article{Allen2001,
abstract = {There is a long tradition of regulating banks and securities markets
in many countries. The primary justification for bank regulation
that is usually given is the avoidance of systemic risk, or in other
words, the avoidance of financial crises. With securities markets
it is usually argued the main purposes of regulation are investor
protection and enhancing the efficiency of markets. Avoidance of
systemic risk, investor protection and efficiency enhancement are
not the only rationales. The achievement of broader social objectives,
such as combating organized crime or facilitating home ownership,
provides the justification for many other regulations.{\textless}p{\textgreater} Table 1
summarizes the role of different types of banking and securities
market regulations in achieving the four objectives of avoiding systemic
risk, protecting retail investors and depositors, enhancing efficiency
and achieving broader social objectives. It can be seen from Panel
A that although banking regulation primarily prevents systemic risk
most policies also impact a number of the other objectives. From
Panel B securities market regulation is directed towards investor
protection and efficiency enhancement.{\textless}p{\textgreater} In recent years the relationship
between banking regulation and securities market regulation has become
an important topic. Emerging markets have been plagued by crises.
The recent Asian crises are a good example. Most of these crises
occurred in bank based financial systems and the non-contingent nature
of banks' liabilities appears to have played an important role in
causing the crises. Banking regulation failed to prevent the occurrence
of the crises. This has led a number of observers to argue that Asian
countries should rely more heavily on financial markets for raising
funds and reduce the role of banks. This raises the important question
of whether securities market regulation would need to be changed
to focus more on systemic risk.{\textless}p{\textgreater} The purpose of this paper is to
consider the inter-relationship of bank regulation and securities
regulation in order to consider whether a move away from a bank-based
financial system towards a market-based system is desirable in terms
of crisis prevention. Section 2 considers banking regulation while
Section 3 focuses on the regulation of securities markets. As has
been stressed, banking regulation is primarily designed to prevent
systemic risk while securities regulation is primarily for investor
protection and efficiency enhancement. But this does not necessarily
imply that a switch from banking to market finance would reduce systemic
risk. Sophisticated financial markets require the participation of
many intermediaries and systemic risk may be created if any of these
go bankrupt and there is contagion to the rest of the financial system.
Changing regulation to prevent this may not be very effective. Section
4 argues that a better way to prevent systemic risk if there is a
move towards market finance and away from bank finance is to structure
bankruptcy law appropriately. Section 5 contains concluding remarks.},

abstract = {Although economists have long promoted inflation-indexed bonds as
a useful tool for debt management and monetary policy, such bonds
remain the exception. Against their use is the belief that indexation
fuels inflation through feedback on prices and expectations. This
view is bolstered by the experience of several countries where, partly
owing to inflation, indexation became widespread beginning in the
1960s and 1970s. Indexation of financial markets in particular was
seen as an expedient to promote domestic savings and capital formation.
By the 1980s the inflation performance in a number of these countries
had deteriorated, in some cases to the point of hyperinflation. Some
have since taken steps to reduce the scope of indexation. In recent
years, another group of sovereign borrowers has successfully integrated
inflation- indexed bonds into existing debt programs and promoted
them because of their purported benefits to issuers and purchasers
alike. Their benefits include improved social welfare, lower debt
costs, easier implementation of monetary policy, enhanced monetary
policy credibility, and the development of domestic capital markets.
Their experience supports a fundamental argument in the literature.that
there is no necessary connection between indexation and inflation.
If inflationary biases result from indexation, they can be offset
by other policies. Design considerations are important to the success
of indexed-bond programs. Decisions must be taken about the choice
of the index and its lag, how indexation is applied, term-to-maturity,
and taxation. Indexed bonds, provided they are introduced in countries
committed to contain inflation, offer benefits that may ensure continued
growth and acceptance. The decision by the U.S. Treasury to introduce
these bonds continues that trend and may accelerate the adoption
of indexed bonds elsewhere.},

abstract = {Foreign banks have had an organizational presence in the United States
since the early 1800s. Until after World War II, the foreign banks'
presence was generally limited. They engaged in trade finance, and
in some cases ethnic banking. The growth really dates to the period
from the mid-1960s to 1990. Banks are service firms, and their growth
reflects a demand for their services. This growth in demand is itself
the consequence of the growth of four other activities: trade, the
Eurodollar market, foreign exchange trading and non-financial foreign
direct investment in the US. {\textless}p{\textgreater}First, the General Agreement on Trade
and Tariffs (GATT), and its successor the World Trade Organization
(WTO), facilitated the rebound of trade from its collapse during
the Great Depression. Since the end of World War II, world trade
has grown more rapidly than world GNP, and this has generated an
increase in the demand for trade financing and the execution of trade
payments. Second, liberalization of capital flows and the growth
of the Eurodollar market from the late 1950s on led many foreign
banks to want to have a presence in the US money markets, and therefore
New York, and perhaps a dollar deposit base as well, to be able to
fund their customers' demand for US dollar loans. Third, the breakdown
of the Bretton Woods systems of fixed exchange rates led to the development
of foreign exchange trading, with New York again appearing as a leading
center. Lastly, as companies in Europe and Japan recovered from World
War II, they first rebuilt their domestic operations. By the mid-1960s
(Europe) or mid-1970s (Japan), many of these companies were ready
to establish operations in the US. As they did so, they wanted their
bankers to accompany them.{\textless}p{\textgreater} As we shall see below, this period
of rapid growth in the presence and role of foreign banks in the

diverse groups within integrated national economies. This paper asks
whether there is similar evidence of {\#}cohesion{\#} across countries
in Europe. The empirical work, based on survey data for France, Germany,
and Italy on attitudes towards membership in the European Community,
finds little evidence, if any. This lack of cross-national cohesion
may exacerbate the conflicts that arise in the process of international
economic integration.},

such units are discussed from the standpoint of monetary theory.
The experience with such units in Chile is discussed. It is argued
that important practical problems in implementing indexation were
solved by creating such indexed units of account. The existing indexed
units of accounts may not be ideal for all purposes, however, and
alternative definitions of the units, relating the units to measures
of income, may also be advantageous. The indexed units of account
might someday be monetized,' i.e., institutions such as debit cards
may be devised to allow the units to be used for all transactions,
so that the role of conventional money might be reduced to clearing-house
functions only. Also a discussion of the 'compensated dollar plan'

abstract = {The distribution of income in a country is traditionally assumed to
shift from relative equality to inequality and back to greater equality
as the country develops. Based on this reasoning, the so-called Kuznets
hypothesis postulates a nonlinear relationship between a measure
of income distribution and the level of economic development. However,
empirical multicountry studies of income distribution have documented
significant residuals in Kuznets-type models even after corrections
have been made for explicit redistribution policies, employment by
the state, regional development, the age profile of the population,
and other factors. Following Milanovic, and using his original data,
this paper augments the Kuznets hypothesis of income inequality by
incorporating inflation and financial deepening (with the latter
defined as the ratio of broad money, M2, to GDP). Using a cross-country
database containing 75 countries, this paper finds that past inflation
affects current levels of income inequality as measured by Gini coefficients
and that these results are robust even after controlling for fiscal
redistribution. The positive impact of price stability on income
distribution is nonlinear: the reduction in inflation from hyperinflationary
levels significantly lowers income inequality, while further reduction
toward a very low level of inflation seems to bring about negligible
additional gains in the Gini coefficient. At the same time, price
stability boosts money demand and helps preserve the real value of
fiscal transfers. Price stabilization therefore seems to offer a
free lunch: there are no medium- or long-term income inequality costs
of disinflation, only benefits},

than in the pre-Volcker period. We then compare some of the implications
of the estimated rules for equilibrium properties of inflation and
output, using a simple macroeconomic model. The pre-Volcker rule
is shown to be consistent with the possibility of persistent, self-fulfilling
fluctuations in inflation and output. In contrast, the Volcker-Greenspan

debate in monetary policy, both from historical and analytical perspectives.
Develops a new index of central bank independence and compares central
bank independence for Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States,
Sweden, and Switzerland. Using a monetary policy game with private
information about the economy, derives several propositions concerning
the relationship between central bank independence, the level and
variance of inflation, and output growth. Tests the propositions
for the twelve countries for the post-Bretton Woods period, 1972-91.
Analyzes central bank independence in the coordination of monetary
and fiscal policies. Considers the optimal degree of central bank
independence in a model that allows for an inflation-sensitive natural
rate of growth. Examines a model in which the optimal degree of central
bank independence is dependent on the aggressiveness of labor unions.

abstract = {One distinguishing feature of internal capital markets is their ability
to reallocate funds in favour of the most profitable divisions (winner-picking).
Yet, diversified firms often trade at a discount with respect to
their focused counterparts. The literature has tried to explain the
apparent misallocation of resources with lobbying activities or power
struggles. We show that the diversification discount can be explained
even in a model where resources are efficiently allocated ex post.
When managers obtain utility from the funds under their purview,
moving funds across divisions may diminish their incentives. The
ex ante reduction in managerial incentives can more than offset the
increase in firm value due to the ex post efficient reallocation
of funds. If headquarters have some commitment power, it is in general
optimal to commit not to reallocate at least a fraction of funds.
As a result, the investment in a given division is (optimally) more
sensitive to the division's cash flow than to other divisions' cash
flow, as confirmed by the empirical studies on internal capital markets.
Our theory complements the view that links the diversification discount
to the inefficient functioning of internal capital markets.},

@article{Cecchetti1995,
abstract = {In recent years, policymakers throughout the world have advocated
that monetary policy shift toward inflation targeting. Recent actions
in the United States serve to highlight the desire of the Federal
Reserve to keep inflation both low and stable, while downplaying
the likely output and employment consequences. But control of inflation
requires both that one be able to forecast its future path, and that
one have estimates of what impact policy changes have on that path.
Unfortunately, inflation is very difficult to forecast even at very
near horizons. This is true because the relationship of candidate
inflation indicators to inflation is neither very strong nor very
stable. Beyond this, the relationship between monetary policy instruments,
such as the federal funds rate, and inflation also varies substantially
over time and cannot be estimated precisely. Construction of policy
rules must take these difficulties into account. Several rules are
examined, and they have the following interesting properties. First,
since prices take time to respond to all types of impulses, the federal
funds rate should be raised immediately following a shock. One should
not wait for prices to rise before acting. Finally, comparison of
the results of price-level targeting with nominal-income targeting
suggest that the difficulties inherent in forecasting and controlling
the former provide an argument for focusing on the latter. Thus:
If professionals can't make a decent prediction then how are 'normal'
people going to make a decent prediction. Backward looking!!},

to severe economic contractions in Japan, Russia, and Southeast Asia.
In response, international organizations have advocated enhanced

is that neither the proponents nor the opponents of enhanced disclosure
policies have persuasive empirical evidence to support their views

that gap by examining the impact of requiring the release of supervisory
information on troubled U.S. banks during a severe banking crisis.
The authors find that improving disclosure at troubled U.S. banks

job of anticipating some of the crises in 1997/1998, but several
weaknesses to the approach are identified. The paper also evaluates
how this system can be applied to an individual country. On balance,

mixing disparate firms may be difficult, but may offer significant

consolidation, based on option pricing, and a model of the {\#}building{\#}{\#}blocks{\#}

identify potential diversification gains from virtually all combinations
involving banking and insurance, which arise because common factors
are combined in different ways and because insurance is already well

This paper looks at the relationship between inflation and the variability

durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Consistent with previous
research on relative price variability within aggregate consumption,
we find inflation is positively correlated with relative price variability
within both nondurables and services. In contrast, we find a negative
correlation between inflation and relative price variability within
durables. Monte Carlo simulations verify the statistical significance
of the results. The results are consistent with a sticky-price model

the need for systematic stress testing of banks' portfolios, including
both their trading and lending books. We propose that underlying
macroeconomic volatility is a key part of a useful conceptual framework
for stress testing credit portfolios, and that credit migration matrices
provide the specific linkages between underlying macroeconomic conditions
and asset quality. Credit migration matrices, which characterize
the expected changes in credit quality of obligors, are cardinal
inputs to many applications, including portfolio risk assessment,
modeling the term structure of credit risk premia, and pricing of
credit derivatives. They are also an integral part of many of the
credit portfolio models used by financial institutions. By separating
the economy into two states or regimes, expansion and contraction,
and conditioning the migration matrix on these states, we show that
the loss distribution of credit portfolios can differ greatly, as
can the concomitant level of economic capital to be assigned to a
bank.},

She shows that Flood and Isard's assumption of symmetric boundary
values of shocks, outside of which the zero-inflation rule should
be broken, is inconsistent as long as the employment target differs
from the natural rate. However, she does not actually solve the model.
Obstfeld (1991, NBER Working Paper, No. 3603) applies this framework
to an exchange-rate escape clause but is unable to solve his model
given a triangular distribution of the supply shocks. This paper
shows how the model can be solved and the optimal escape clause derived
assuming a uniform distribution. Numerical examples suggest that
the optimal boundary values in the consistent model are highly asymmetric},

litigation and regulation based on the idea that justice can be subverted
with sufficient expenditure of resources. The model suggests that
courts are more vulnerable to subversion than regulators, especially
in an environment of significant inequality of wealth and political
power. The switch to regulation can then be seen as an efficient
response to the subversion of justice by robber barons during the
Gilded Age. The model makes sense of the progressive reform agenda,

Financial managers most often use the CAPM for estimating the cost

the market risk premium. The CAPM as a model has been seriously challenged
in the academic literature. In addition recent research indicates
that the true market risk premium might have been as low as half
the historical U.S. equity premium during the last two decades. If
business finance courses have been teaching the use of the wrong
model along with wrong inputs for twenty years, why has no one complained?

concerning bank regulatory policies in Japan over the turbulent 1995-
1998 period. We find that investors grouped banks according to regulatory
status in assessing whether a bank was currently treated as too-big-to-fail.
when a failure of a bank of certain regulatory status was anounced,
excess returns on other banks of that regulatory status and below
displayed heightened sensitivity to adverse news. This suggests that
investors updated their beliefs about which classes of banks were
protected by too-big-to-fail policies over the course of the sample.
The pattern that emerges suggests that government officials pursued
a policy of regulatory triage, where initially Credit Cooperatives,
then Second Regional banks, then First Regional banks, and finally
City banks were allowed to fail.},

short rate and term spread information forecast better, match sample
moments better, and classify regimes better than univariate models.
We show that the regimes in interest rates correspond reasonably
well with business cycles, at least in the US. This may explain why
regime-switching models forecast interest rates better than single
regime models. Finally, the non-linear interest rate dynamics implied
by regime-switching models have potentially important implications
for the macroeconomic literature documenting the effects of monetary
policy shocks on economic aggregates. Moreover, the implied volatility
and drift functions are rich enough to resemble those recently estimated

Interbank credit lines allow to cope with these liquidity shocks while reducing the cost of maintaining reserves. However, the interbank market exposes the system to a coordination failure (gridlock equilibrium) even if all banks are solvent. When one bank is insolvent, the stability of the banking system is affected in various ways depending on the patterns of payments across locations. We investigate the ability of the banking industry to withstand the insolvency of one bank and whether the closure of one bank generates a chain reaction on the rest of the system. We analyze the coordinating role of the Central Bank in preventing payments systemic repercussions and we examine the justification of the Too-big-to-fail-policy.},

@article{Bordo1998,
abstract = {In this paper we analyze the changing role of gold in the international
monetary system, in particular the persistence of gold holdings by
monetary authorities for 20 years following the breakdown of the
Brettone Woods system system and the Second Amendment to the Articles
of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund which severed the
formal link to gold. We stress four points. First, the gold-exchange
standard was a recent arrangement that emerged only around 1900 in
response to a set of historically-specific factors which also help
to account for it smooth operation. How long those factors would
have continued to support it will never be known, due to a great
war and then a great depression. Second, a system which relied on
inelastically supplied precious metal and elastcially suppled foreign
exchange to meet the the world economy's demand for reserves was
intrinsically fragile, prone to confidence problems, and a transmission
belt for policy mistakes. Third, network externalities, statutory
restrictions and habit all contributed to the persistence of the
practice of holding gold reserves. But the hold of even factors as
powerful as these inevitably weakens with time and the effects of
their erosion are reinforced by the rise of international capital
mobility, which increases the ease of holding other forms of reserves,
both unborrowed and borrowed, and by the shift to greater exchange-rate
flexibility, which according to our results diminishes the demand
for reserves in general. Fourth and finally, network externalities,
in conjunction with central bankers' collective sense of responsibility
for the stability of the price of what remains an important reserve
asset, suggest that the same factors which have long held in place
the practice of holding gold reserves, when they come unstuck, may
become unstuck all at once.},

by setting acceptance criteria for granting loans, taking regulatory
requirements into account. By easing its acceptance criteria a bank
faces a trade-off between attracting more demand for loans, thus
making higher per period profits, and a deterioration of the quality
of its loan portfolio, thus tolerating a higher risk of failure.
Our main results state that more stringent capital adequacy requirements
lead banks to set stricter acceptance criteria, and that increased
competition in the banking industry leads to riskier bank behavior.
In an extension of our basic model, we show that it may be beneficial
for a bank to hold more equity than prescribed by the regulator,
even though holding equity is more expensive than attracting deposits.},

of the more technical parts begins with a general overview with no
mathematics. Articles in part 1 consider basic issues dealing with
a range of markets in which price movements take place because of
speculation, discussing stock prices and social dynamics, and fashions,
fads, and bubbles in financial markets. Part 2 focuses on the stock
market, covering stock market volatility; whether prices have moved
too much to be justified by subsequent changes in dividends; the
use of volatility measures to assess market efficiency; the probability
of gross violations of the present value variance inequality; stock
prices, earnings, and expected dividends; a Monte Carlo study of
the dividend ratio model and small sample bias; comovements in prices
and dividends; and factors and fundamentals. Part 3 concerns the
bond market, including a survey of volatility; the Gibson paradox
and historical movements in real interest rates; the volatility of
long-term interest rates and expectations models of the term structure;
and tests of present value models. The fourth part examines the real
estate market. Part 5 discusses the aggregate economy, focusing on
sources of aggregate variability and determinants of stock market
price variability. The last part reviews popular models and investor
behavior, including the 1987 market crash and home buyer booms and
busts. Shiller is Stanley B. Resor Professor of Economics at the

performance of six leaver' nations is compared with five stayer'

Mark. Recent writing about post-1992, which I call the conventional
wisdom,' reports that a surprising miracle occurred the leaver nations
are alleged to have enjoyed a burst of real growth and a decline
in unemployment, all without any evidence of extra inflation. The
results in this paper turn the conventional wisdom on its head. While
the leaver nations experienced an acceleration of nominal GDP growth
relative to the stayers, fully 80 percent of this spilled over into
extra inflation, leaving only 20 percent remaining for extra real
GDP growth. Virtually 100 percent of the nominal exchange rate depreciation
passed through into higher import prices, and extra inflation would
have been even more pronounced if it were not for quiescent wage
rates, which the paper attributes to high unemployment. The absence
of any significant stimulus to real output growth is attributed to
fiscal tightening under pressure from the Maastricht criteria, which
offset nearly all of the stimulus coming from the improved current
account of the leaver nations.},

from countries (notably Chile) that have created indexed units of
account, suggests that creating such units is an important policy
option for governments in countries with unstable price levels. A
model is given that shows the dynamics of money prices when prices
are expressed in the units. Results from the model suggest some design
elements for an indexed unit of account: institutions to promote
broad use of the unit for pricing, and a formal policy to increase
the frequency of index computation when the price level becomes more

of credit ratings, maturity and currency denomination on spreads.
The authors find important regional differences in spreads across
the developing world, even after controlling for risk and maturity.
They also identify the evolution of spreads during the 1990's up
until the advent of the Asian financial crisis, holding other determinants
constant, and find that emerging market spreads declined by more
than can be explained by improvements in risk. However, for emerging
market instruments with relatively favorable credit ratings, trends
in spreads differed considerably from those experienced by Brady
bonds. Finally, and in contrast to much market commentary, the authors
find that variations in industrial country short-term interest rates
explain relatively little of the decline in emerging market bond
spreads. Longer-term trends, along with the temporary impact of the
Mexican financial crisis, may have been more important factors in
the behavior of emerging market spreads.},

that the forecasts were very bad. Either the surveys didn't capture
forecasters' expectations, or forecasters didn't have rational expectations.
However, the sample period being examined consisted mostly of data
from the volatile 1970s, when forecasting was extremely difficult.
The question is: If we run the same types of tests that were performed
15 years ago on an updated sample, will we find the same problems
with the forecasts? This paper finds that much of the empirical work
from 15 years ago does not stand the test of time. The forecast errors
from the surveys aren't nearly as bad today as they were in the 1970s.
However, some problems remain in the forecasts. It appears to be
possible to improve inflation forecasts over some sample periods
using bias regressions, and the forecasts don't pass all tests for
optimality.},

is unsure about the natural rate of unemployment and the slope of

of behaving optimally given its current beliefs, or taking actions
that are currently sub-optimal but which yield new information, and
hence improve future performance. Using dynamic programming results
from Easley and Kiefer(1988), this paper shows that the Central Bank
may come to believe that there is an exploitable relationship between
inflation and output, even when no such relationship exists. Thus,
this paper provides another reason why monetary policy may be subject
to a persistent inflation bias.},

@article{Jadresic1998,
abstract = {Since the mid-1970s, there has been considerable research on the macroeconomic
consequences of wage indexation. Most of the academic literature
on this subject has studied the effects of wage indexation under
the key assumption that indexing is with respect to current inflation.
However, indexed wage contracts generally adjust wages to the evolution
of prices infrequently and with a lag, so that typical cost of living
adjustments are determined according to lagged inflation rather than
current inflation. Drawing on recent research by the author, this
paper reviews the macroeconomic consequences of wage indexation,
treating wage indexation explicitly as a clause in long-term contracts
that grants periodic wage adjustments according to lagged inflation.
Specifically, the paper reviews the consequences of wage indexation
to lagged inflation on the aggregate wage, the cost of disinflation
under money- and exchange-rate-based stabilization, the variability
of output under alternative types of shocks and policy regimes, the
choice of exchange rate regime, and the level and variability of
inflation. Two main lessons emerge from this review. The first one
is that the standard analysis of wage indexation in the academic
literature can provide a very misleading picture of the consequences
of the typical type of wage indexation observed in real life. In
particular, the assumption that wages are indexed to current inflation
can be of little use even as a gross approximation to the issue.
The second lesson is that taking into account the lags in actual
wage indexation validates the views that most policymakers and applied
observers seem to hold on the consequences of wage indexation, although
with some qualifications.},

@article{Vives1996,
abstract = {After the Savings and Loans debacle and the solvency problems of banks
in a host of countries the book by Dewatripont and Tirole comes to
illuminate the thorny issues associated with the prudential regulation
of financial institutions using an insightful and coherent analysis.
The authors argue that the main goal of regulation is the protection
of small depositors and that the main tool to accomplish it is to
bring about an efficient corporate governance structure for banks.
According to Dewatripont and Tirole the distinguishing feature of
banks is that their debt is held by small investors who are not able
or willing to monitor banks' activity. Hence, depositors need to
be represented by a public or private agent. Aside from this, banking
regulation must deal with essentially the same issues that arise
in connection with the control of firms by large creditors. The starting
point of Dewatripont and Tirole is to consider a bank as a managerial
firm. Then, they confront the challenge of explaining why the capital
structure of banks, that is, their solvency or debt/equity ratio,
matters from the point of view of a manager's performance. Indeed,
we know from the Modigliani-Miller theorem that if complete contracts
between owners and managers could be written then financial structure
would be irrelevant. To get around this the authors turn to the incomplete
contract paradigm to build their model. A key assumption is that
external intervention, which is crucial to affect managerial incentives,
is noncontractible. The view is that the incentives that can be offered
to managers are limited by problems of verifying the bank's performance.
Dewatripont and Tirole's basic model is extremely simple. They consider
a manager whose unobservable effort affects the quality of the bank's
loan portfolio and whose only objective is to preserve the private
rents (perks and so on) of staying in the job. Furthermore, the party
who has control over the bank (be it shareholders or debtholders),
can choose only between a risky continue and a conservative stop
action (involving possibly a reorganization, cancellation of projects,
. . .). Efficiency then requires that there should be more interference
with management when the (verifiable) performance of the bank is
poor. The optimal managerial incentive scheme can be implemented
in a variety of ways, including contingent control mechanisms, net
worth adjust ments, and a recapitalization scheme. The basic idea
is always the same: When performance is good, control should stay
with shareholders who have a tendency to be passive--that is, to
continue with the risky course. This is so because shareholders have
a convex return structure due to limited liability. When performance
is poor, control has to change to debtholders/depositors, who have
a tendency to be interventionist, that is, to choose a conservative
course for the bank. This is so because this group has a concave
return structure. The threshold for the change in control can be
interpreted as a minimum solvency requirement. This can be complemented
with recapitalization following a bad performance and an extra allowance
for dividend distribution when performance is good. These ideas constitute
the core of the book and are nicely presented in Part III. Before
that, Part I provides a truly remarkable description of banking regulation
institutions with particular attention to the Basle Accords (1988)
and U.S. regulations. This part also includes a description of the
U.S. S{\&}L crisis. Part II contains background material on some theoretical
models of banking and an outline of the main argument. Part IV of
the book contains the application to regulation of the ideas developed
in Part II. It provides a penetrating analysis of the strengths and
weaknesses of the Basle Accords, and discusses also the role of securitization,
the political economy of regulation, and the tradeoffs associated
with private remedies such as rating agencies, private deposit insurance,
and the role of uninsured subordinated debt. The implications for
regulatory practice are gathered in Part V. The authors conclude
that market value accounting should be introduced when feasible,
with net worth adju stments to compensate for macroeconomic shocks,
that solvency measures should take account of interest rate and market
risk, and not only credit risk (which should be handled at the portfolio
level), and that private rating agencies should be used with caution.
Furthermore, it is argued that a broad deposit insurance system is
preferable, and that the Basle Accords on solvency roughly approximate
the optimal governance structure except that account should be taken
of macroeconomic shocks. In good times they should be offset with
dividend distributions and in bad times with recapitalization complemented
perhaps with a subsidy scheme. All this makes good economic sense
and some recommendations coincide with those derived from other approaches
to banking regulation like the classical portfolio approach. In this
sense it would have been nice if the authors had devoted some more
space to contrasting their recommendations with the received results
in the literature. Both the strength and the weakness of the book
lie in its adoption of a definite point of view. According to the
authors the prudential regulation of banks is a matter of finding
the optimal governance structure in a context where depositors need
to be represented (and protected). The advantage of the approach
is that it provides a coherent framework, based in incomplete contract
theory, in which to understand regulation (and this is exploited
magnificently by the authors). A disadvantage is that it obviates
a (and for some the) major concern of banking regulation: systemic
risk and the preservation of the stability and smooth functioning
of the banking and payments system. On the methodological front,
the model presented by the authors is very streamlined and several
aspects of it may be open to question. However, it must be acknowledged
that, as of today, there is still no well established foundation
for why contracts may be incomplete and therefore the assumptions
made by the authors are not un common in the literature. All in all
this book has more than accomplished its self- imposed task of contributing
to the foundations of a theory of regulation of financial intermediaries.
The book is a must both for academics and for practitioners interested
in the prudential regulation of banks.},

Fragility commits banks to creating liquidity, enabling depositors

abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptual framework to investigate the effects
of central bank independence, of the degree of centralization of
wage bargaining and of the interaction between those institutional
variables, on real wages, unemployment and inflation, in a framework
in which unions are averse to inflation. This aversion moderates
union's wage demands as they attempt to induce the central bank to
inflate at a lower rate. An increase in the degree of centralization
of wage bargaining (a decrease in the number of unions) triggers
two opposite effects on real wages, unemployment and inflation. It
reduces the substitutability between the labor of different unions
and therefore the degree of effective competition between them. This
'reduced competition effect' raises real wages, unemployment and
inflation. But the decrease in the number of unions also strengthens
the moderating effect of inflationary fears on the real wage demands
of each union. This 'strategic effect' lowers real wages, unemployment
and inflation. For sufficiently inflation averse unions the interaction
between those two effects produces a Calmfors-Driffill type relation
between real wages and centralization. The paper analyzes the effects
of central bank independence on the position and the shape of this
relation, as well as on inflation and unemployment. The paper features
two mechanisms, one of which is novel, through which monetary institutions
have real effects. The model implies that if there is a single union
social welfare is maximized when the central bank attaches a zero
weight to inflation. But when the number of unions is larger than
one this result is no longer true in general. Empirical evaluation
of some of the theoretical implications, using data from nineteen
developed economies, is for the most part supportive of those implications.},

and time period analysed. In this paper we review critically works
that cover the main sectors of the financial industry (commercial
and investment banks, insurance and asset management companies) in
the major industrialised countries over the last twenty years, searching
for common patterns that transcend national and sectoral peculiarities.
We find that consolidation in the financial sector is beneficial
up to a relatively small size in order to reap economies of scale,
but there is little evidence that mergers yield economies of scope
or gains in managerial efficiency.},

organize our empirical approach as a tructural (albeit eclectic)

in a framework where the high persistence in both series allows us
to differentiate between permanent and transitory components. Our
eclecticism comes from using three alternative identifying schemes
which fit the data equally well, but place different emphasis on
the effects of demand shocks on the unemployment rate. Our estimates
suggest, according to the reader's prior belief (Keynesian or monetarist),
that a one percentage point reduction in inflation following an aggregate
demand contraction is associated with cumulated output losses of
between 2.6{\%} and 5{\%} over five years.},

Yes it did. We update tests of the credibility of the EMS exchange

survey of exchange rate forecasts, as well as interest differentials,
in measuring exchange rate expectations. We investigate the hypothesis--suggested
by the apparent stabilization of the EMS and by recent institutional
developments--that the EMS target zones have experienced an increase
in credibility since their 1987 realignment. The evidence tends to
support this hypothesis for most currencies studied. We also examine
the empirical failure of standard target zone models, but find no
evidence that it can be attributed to mismeasurement of expectations.
Finally, we consider an alternative credibility measure which captures
the importance of possible realignments in overall expectations of
exchange rate changes.},

explanations. First, Europeans prefer more equal societies (inequality
belongs in the utility function for Europeans but not for Americans).
Second, social mobility is (or is perceived to be) higher in the
US so being poor is not seen as affecting future income. We test
these hypotheses by partitioning the sample across income and ideological
lines. There is evidence of 'inequality generated' unhappiness in
the US only for a sub-group of rich leftists. In Europe inequality
makes the poor unhappy, as well as the leftists. This favors the
hypothesis that inequality affects European happiness because of
their lower social mobility (since no preference for equality exists
amongst the rich or the right). The results help explain the greater
popular demand for government to fight inequality in Europe relative

be used for transactions as a means of creating a base for seignorage.
Thus agents hold multiple currencies to deal with uncertainty in
their optimal consumption bundles. We argue that this equilibrium
is Pareto dominated by a monetary union, in which there is a single
currency and a strong central bank that optimally chooses zero inflation.
As suggested by the European Commission's 1990 report, monetary union
reduces the inefficiencies created by multiple currencies and leads
to price stability. Finally, we argue this Pareto superior outcome
cannot be achieved without cooperation of the two governments.},

linkages may reduce the costs of information flows between the lender

this issue, we first document that banks are heavily involved in
the corporate governance network through frequent board linkages.
Banks tend to have larger boards with a higher proportion of outside
directors than non- financial firms, and bank officer-directors tend
to have more external board directorships than executives of non-
financial firms. We then show that low- information cost firms --
large firms with a high proportion of tangible assets and relatively
stable stock returns -- are most likely to have board connections
to banks. These same low- information cost firms are also more likely
to borrow from their connected bank, and when they do so the terms
of the loan appear similar to loans to unconnected firms. In contrast
to studies of Mexico, Russia and Asia where connections have been
misused, our results suggest that avoidance of potential conflicts
of interest explains both the allocation and behavior of bankers
in the U.S. corporate governance system.},

are less willing than small banks to lend to informationally 'difficult'

Moreover, controlling for the endogeneity of bank-firm matching,
large banks lend at a greater distance, interact more impersonally
with their borrowers, have shorter and less exclusive relationships,
and do not alleviate credit constraints as effectively. All of this
is consistent with small banks being better able to collect and act

abstract = {bstract: We provide a general framework for integration of high-frequency
intraday data into the measurement, modeling and forecasting of daily
and lower frequency return volatilities and return distributions.
Most procedures for modeling and forecasting financial asset return
volatilities, correlations, and distributions rely on potentially
restrictive and complicated parametric multivariate ARCH or stochastic
volatility models. Use of realized volatility constructed from high-frequency
intraday returns, in contrast, permits the use of traditional time-series
methods for modeling and forecasting. Building on the theory of continuous-time
arbitrage-free price processes and the theory of quadratic variation,
we develop formal links between realized volatility and the conditional
covariance matrix. Next, using continuously recorded observations
for the Deutschemark/Dollar and Yen/Dollar spot exchange rates covering
more than a decade, we find that forecasts from a simple long-memory
Gaussian vector autoregression for the logarithmic daily realized
volatilities perform admirably compared to a variety of popular daily
ARCH and more complicated high-frequency models. Moreover, the vector
autoregressive volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal-normal
mixture distribution implied by the theoretically and empirically
grounded assumption of normally distributed standardized returns,
produces well-calibrated density forecasts of future returns, and
correspondingly accurate quantile predictions. Our results hold promise
for practical modeling and forecasting of the large covariance matrices
relevant in asset pricing, asset allocation and financial risk management

abstract = {We assess the welfare implications of banking competition under various
deposit insurance regimes in a model of imperfect competition with
social failure costs and where banks are subject to limited liability.
We study the links between competition for deposits and risk taking
incentives, and conclude that the welfare performance of the market
and the appropriateness of alternative regulatory measures depend
on the degree of rivalry and the deposit insurance regime. Specifically,
when competition is intense and the social failure costs high, deposit
rates are excessive both in a free market and with risk-based insurance.
If insurance premiums are insensitive to risk then the same is true
even if there is no social cost of failure. We find also that in
an uninsured market with nonobservable portfolio risk or with flat-premium
deposit insurance deposit regulation (rate regulation or deposit
limits) and direct asset restrictions are complementary tools to
improve welfare. In an uninsured market with observable portfolio
risk or with risk-based insurance deposit regulation may be a sufficient
instrument to improve welfare.},

forecasts are useful for risk management; hence the interest in volatility
forecastability in the risk management literature. Volatility forecastability,
however, varies with horizon, and different horizons are relevant
in different applications. Moreover, existing assessments of forecastability
are plagued by the fact that they are joint assessments of volatility
forecastability and an assumed model, and the results vary not only
with the horizon, but also with the assumed model. To address this
problem, we develop a model-free procedure for assessing volatility
forecastability across horizons. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that
volatility forecastability decays quickly with horizon. Volatility
forecastability, although clearly of relevance for risk management
at the short horizons relevant for, say, trading desk management,
may not be important for risk management more generally.},

devices for controlling (governing) any type of corporation. Most
national governments have instituted nonmarket regulatory mechanisms

not adequately discipline banks. But what evidence supports this
assessment? Why must governments assure bank solvency, but not the
solvency of other firms? Government oversight naturally displaces
private efforts to evaluate and control financial firms. Moreover,
if the banking business changes over time--as it assuredly has in
the past decade or two--the best combination of government and private
supervision may change concurrently. This paper reviews and evaluates
the growing empirical literature on private investors' abilities
to assess the financial condition of banking firms. The evidence
supports the proposition that market investors and analysts could
reasonably provide a greater proportion of corporate governance services

data, were used investigate in the question whether the framework
of the Maastricht Treaty has established a new kind of commitment
to fiscal stability which has enabled European governments to overcome
the political economy problems of austerity measures even in a period
of rising unemployment or a decline in economic growth. Our major
finding is that the Treaty about the European Union has indeed established
a new way to promote fiscal restraint even in countries which have
had a long tradition of running politically motivated high public
deficits. By imposing an irrevocable framework of international self-commitment
on governments, it not only relies on the usual scape-goat effect
of international relations in domestic politics, but also uses the
peoples' positive attitude towards European integration to stabilize
governments which otherwise would have found themselves in far greater
political trouble when deciding to consolidate national budgets.
Our theoretical argument thus enlarges the common ideas of political
economy and public choice by overcoming the notion that the voter
is ignorant about international affairs. Our empirical evidence shows
that there is a distinguished effect of the Maastricht commitment
on fiscal policies in Europe, and strengthens the conjecture that
it is the support for the EU and the character of EMU as a genuinely
European project which has made a fundamental change in economic
policy all over Western Europe possible. The unique combination of
the international character of the Maatricht commitment and the Europeans'
persistent support for the EU project thus provide the framework
for fiscal reform in Europe.},

abstract = {A stylised fact of monetary policy making is that central banks do
not immediately respond to new information but rather seem to prefer
to wait until sufficient 'evidence' to warrant a change has accumulated.
However, theoretical models of inflation targeting imply that an
optimising central bank should continuously respond to shocks. This
paper attempts to explain this stylised fact by introducing a small
menu cost which is incurred every time the central bank changes the
interest rate. It is shown that this produces a relatively large
range of inaction because this cost will induce the central bank
to take the option value of the status quo into account. In other
words, because action is costly the central bank will have an incentive
to wait and see whether or not the economy will move closer to the
inflation target of its own accord. Next, the paper analyses the
implications for the time series properties of interest rates. In
particular, we examine the effect of the interest rate sensitivity
of aggregate demand, the slope of the Lucas supply function and the
variance of demand shocks on the size of the interest rate step and
the expected length of the time period till the next interest rate
step. Finally, we analyse the effect of menu costs on inflationary
expectations. In this respect we find that the economy will suffer
from an inflationary bias if the cost of raising the interest rate
exceeds the cost of lowering it.},

for the first time, the determinants of banks' assets held by non-banks

underlying model used to measure banks' foreign assets held by non-banks
in this study, is based on those models which have measured the determinants
of banks' total foreign assets and international inter-bank activities.
The empirical results of this model suggest a positive relationship
with foreign direct investment in banking and banks' foreign assets
held by non-banks. Other significant factors identified include bilateral
trade, the value of national income, and the real interest rate differential.
Furthermore, banks' foreign assets held by non-banks are found to
be significantly related to the respective level of inter-bank dealings,
such that a restriction on the overall amount of activities exists.
Finally, global bank flows of opposite directions are found to be
positively correlated, highlighting the fact that the perceived risk
of foreign lending is reduced by simultaneous increases in banks'
foreign liabilities.},

of standard models of representative consumer and firm behavior to
replicate the dynamics that we observe in the aggregate data. In
essence, these models fail because they imply that both inflation
and real variables must ``jump'' in response to monetary policy (and
other) shocks, in contrast to identified VAR evidence that shows
a gradual, ``hump-shaped'' response. This paper discusses a rigorous
empirical standard for monetary policy models. The motivation for
this discussion is that, if one wishes to conduct welfare analysis,
one must be reasonably confident that the model provides a good approximation
to underlying consumer and firm behavior over the monetary policy
horizon, i.e., in the short-run. The paper examines a specific alternative
to the standard consumption model in which consumers' utility depends
in part on current consumption relative to past consumption. This
formulation of habit formation allows one to nest habit formation,
life-cycle consumption, and Campbell and Mankiw's ``rule-of-thumb''
consumers within a more general model. The empirical tests developed
in the paper show that one can reject the hypothesis of no habit
formation with tremendous confidence. This result suggests that models
that are unable to produce a hump-shaped response will be strongly
rejected empirically.},

abstract = {The object of this paper is to develop an Early Warning System of
Macro Vulnerability for several Latin American countries based on
previous work of Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1997) and Kaminsky
(1998). We build a composite leading indicator that signals macroeconomic
vulnerability, showing that, historically, crises tend to happen
in these ``vulnerable'' situations. The main differences with Kaminsky's
approach are, 1) we use a reduced set of variables to generate the
signals, 2) the variables were first aggregated and then the signal
was issued depending on the behavior of the composite index, as opposed
to Kaminsky's procedure of generating signals with each individual
variable and then aggregating these. The results are very satisfactory
on the statistical and operational fronts: on the statistical side,
Type I and Type II errors are smaller than those reported in previous
papers. Operationally, this system of leading indicators is less
costly to maintain given the reduced set of primary variables involved,
their wide-spread availability and the timeliness with which they
are reported. The models' out-of-sample predictive ability are tested
with plenty of crises cases occurring after the first stage of this
project was finished: Colombia (September, 1998), Brazil (January,
1999), and Ecuador (February,1999). All the cases were correctly
anticipated by the signals of vulnerability issued by the models.
Additionally, Mexico's models , estimated with information available
two years before the crisis, show that these signaling devices would
have been useful anticipating the 1994 crisis.},

holding company is significantly safer than either a stand-alone
bank or a bank affiliated with a one- bank holding company. Not only
does affiliation reduce the probability of future financial distress,
but distressed affiliated banks are more likely to receive capital
injections and recover more quickly than other banks. Moreover, the
effects of affiliation are strengthened for an expanding bank holding
company. However, the effects of affiliation are weakened when the
parent has less than full ownership of the subsidiary. Most interestingly,
my results show that these differences in behavior across affiliation
did not exist before 1989, when the cross-guarantee authority was
introduced.},

But the coefficients in efficient Taylor rules differ from the coefficients

are efficient. Indeed, the set of efficient rules is equivalent to
the set of inflation-target policies with different speeds of adjustment.
Finally, nominal-income targets are not merely inefficient, but disastrous:

affected these policies. In the absence of this theory, the contributors

sharply in the 1930s with little or no historical precedent or by
showing how policies were tied to political or other considerations
unique to the period. While this volume doesn't always provide answers
to the questions posed, it does raise a fundamental issue in the

This is an important issue because cost and regulatory burden considerations
often cause CAMEL ratings to be assigned relatively infrequently.
As a benchmark for information content, we use econometric forecasts

available accounting data. When compared with all CAMEL ratings available
at a given point in time, the econometric forecasts provide a more
accurate indication of failure. Further analysis reveals that this

I have derived in collaboration with Fumiko Kon-Ya and Yoshiro Tsutsui.
Five different time-series indicators whether there is among investors
an expectation of a speculative bubble, an unstable situation with
expectations for increase in the short run only, are produced. Four
different time-series indicators whether there is an expectation
of a negative speculative bubble are presented. Four different time-series
indicators of investor confidence, that nothing can go wrong, are
produced. Time-series variation for these indicators is significant,
and cross correlations are generally positive. A bubble expectations
index, a negative-bubble expectations index, and an investor confidence
index are derived from these indicators. Behavior of the indicators
and indexes through time is examined, and the indexes are compared
with other economic variables. A notable finding is a degree of high-frequency
fluctuation, semester to semester, in the indexes.},

@article{Goolsbee1998,
abstract = {An influential literature on the effects of marginal tax rates on
the behavior of the rich has claimed that the elasticity of taxable
income with respect to the net of tax share is very high possibly
exceeding one. These high estimated elasticities imply that cutting
taxes on the rich does not lose much revenue possibly increases it
and that progressivity generates a large amount of deadweight loss.
To identify this elasticity, these studies have conducted natural
experiments' comparing the rich to other income groups and assuming
that they are the same except for changes in their tax rates. This
paper tests the natural experiment assumption using alternative data
on the compensation of a panel of several thousand corporate executives
and finds it to be false. Relatively, the very rich have incomes
which trend upward at a faster rate are more sensitive to economic
conditions, and are more likely to be in a form whose timing can
be shifted in the short run. Interpreted broadly, these facts might
reduce existing elasticity estimates by as much as 75{\%}. The paper
also suggests ways of improving existing methods. Reasons for lower
elasticity are: 1) Secular trends in income inequality which are
not related to taxation dramatically alter estimated elasticities
from the 1980s. 2) The pay of the very rich is about twice as responsive
to demand conditions and firm performance as is the pay of the moderately
rich. 3) The very rich have a much greater share of income in forms
whose timing can be shifted thus making their relative responsiveness
in a natural experiment much higher in the short run than in the
long run.},

that elected politicians have incentives to expand the money supply

an institutional solution to this problem. However, this solution

principals, perhaps because they are conservative (more inflation-averse).

no change in market conduct of banks between 1986 and 1989. The results
suggest that banks in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Spain

having earned revenues as if under monopoly or conjectural variations

of a lack of integration in EC banking markets and they thus underline
the importance of the Second Banking Directive, the associated supervisory

of self-justification. Provides an introduction to the World Bank
and its history since its creation in 1944. Discusses how the long
presidency of Robert McNamara, from 1968 until 1981, deeply marked
the Bank's thought and action. Considers the doctrine and limitations
of structural adjustment; how, despite the Bank's claims to near-infallibility,
it has consistently miscalled major economic trends with dire consequences
for its borrowers; the World Bank's former chief economist, Larry
Summers, as the near-perfect embodiment of the Bank's neoliberal
views; and the Bank's internal culture and the traumatic 1987 reorganization
that set the Bank's end-of-the-century agenda. Discusses the challenge
environmentalists pose to the Bank's economic orthodoxy; the Bank's
claims to intellectual leadership and its negative attitude toward
unconventional or dissenting ideas; the Bank's leadership; and its
external and self-images. George is Associate Director of the Transnational

abstract = {Ordinal response scales with a middle category are widely used in
public opinion studies, psychology, medicine, computed tomography
and other fields. The usual models in the statistical literature
for ordinal response variables treat the case where the scale has
a natural middle category no differently from the case where the
scale does not have a middle category. This paper proposes new models
for the analysis of ordinal response scales with middle categories,
applying these to data collected in 1993-1994 on American opinion
toward the balance between environmental quality and economic prosperity.
Some of the models should also be useful when the scale does not
have a natural middle category. The models are easily used to address
issues of concern in empirical work---for example, stochastic ordering
among covariate classes and asymmetry about the middle category.
Log-linear models are considered in Section 2. The relationship between
the normal distribution and a quadratic log-linear model with known
scores, discussed in this section, is the basis for Section 3, which
considers a log-nonlinear model with unknown scores estimated from
the data. Section 4 shows how generalized log-linear and generalized
log-nonlinear models can be used to simultaneously study whether
the response is below, at, or above the midpoint, and the conditional
distribution of responses above (below) the midpoint. These models
are also useful when the response scale is viewed as nested and/or
the response process is sequential.},

We test our model on a sample of large banking firms, and label banks

greater financial flexibility have greater value, and (2) banks with
greater financial flexibility devote a smaller percentage of assets
to cash and marketable securities, consistent with the notion that
financial flexibility reduces the sensitivity of firm profits to
internal wealth shocks, thus reducing the firm's need to carry financial

The degree of pass-through from exchange rate changes to inflation
is assumed to depend on the degree of openness of the country, on
unutilized capacity at home and abroad, on the price of oil and on
the wage, fiscal and monetary policies followed by the country after
devaluation. Inflation equations are then estimated for consumer
and wholesale prices using pooled data referring to 80 episodes of
devaluations/depreciations for seven industrial countries during
the period 1966-93. The tests show that the macroeconomic policy
followed by the country significantly influences the degree of pass-through
and that the 1992-93 episodes do not constitute a break with respect
to previous devaluation episodes when inflation accelerated sharply.},

For a sample of Italian firms, it finds that investments improve

abstract = {In a previous attempt to articulate the costs of inflation (Leigh-Pemberton
(1992)), the Bank of England outlined the following costs of a fully-anticipated
inflation: - the cost of economising on real money balances -- so-called
shoe-leather' effects; - the costs of operating a less-than-perfectly
indexed tax system; - the costs of front-end loading' of nominal
debt contracts; - the cost of constantly revising price lists --
so called menu costs' Feldstein (1996) quantified the first two of
these costs when moving from 2{\%} inflation to price stability in the
U.S. Feldstein concluded that the permanent welfare gains through
these two channels -- suitably discounted -- alone exceeded the transient
costs of doing so. This paper aims to replicate Feldstein's analysis
for the U.K. Welfare effects are quantified using deadweight loss
analysis familiar from public finance economics. Because inflation
exacerbates tax distortions that exist even without inflation, the
welfare costs are trapezoids rather than the usual triangles, or,
alternatively, first-order rather than second-order losses. We find
that the welfare gains from moving to price stability through the
two channels identified above are lower in},

abstract = {Does the choice of the nominal exchange rate regime systematically
influence the behavior of key macroeconomic variables, nominal or
real? Economic theory has yet to yield unambiguous conclusions: increased
nominal exchange rate flexibility has been argued both to aggravate
and to reduce output variability, to enhance and to suppress trade,
to raise and to lower investment, and to raise and to lower inflation.
Revealed preference, moreover, does not suggest a clear ranking among
exchange rate regimes. Eighty-six of the 136 countries sampled in
this paper pursued some form of exchange rate peg, while the remaining
50 allowed their currencies to float. Deriving clear rankings is
made difficult by the plethora of partly offsetting and partly reinforcing
linkages between the exchange rate regime and a number of macroeconomic
variables. Without evidence on which of these channels matters empirically,
few general conclusions are possible. This paper presents stylized
facts on the link between the exchange rate regime and two key macroeconomic
variables--inflation and growth. A general, positive association
is found between the degree of nominal exchange rate regime flexibility
and inflation, a link deriving both from lower money supply growth
(a discipline effect) and higher money demand growth (a credibility
effect) under fixed rates. In contrast, overall growth performance
is not found to differ across exchange rate regimes, though growth
tends to be more variable under fixed exchange rate regimes. The
sources of growth, however, do vary significantly across regimes.
Countries operating under fixed rates invest more and are more open,
while countries under flexible rates enjoy faster residual productivity

abstract = {The design of rules for central bank policy has been a subject of
increasing interest to many monetary economists. The purpose of this
essay is first to present an analytical structure in which a policymaker
is presumed to formulate a rule based on the solution to an optimal
control problem, and then to examine a number of issues that are
germane to the current debate on the nature of such rules. These
issues include the implication for policymaking of the slope of the
output-inflation variability frontier, the importance of various
types of uncertainty, the consequences of a zero nominal interest
rate floor, and the possible reasons for interest rate smoothing.
Although this essay is intended to raise, rather than resolve, key
questions concerning policy rules, it does offer fairly compelling
evidence on one point. This concerns the potential consequences of
the move by many central banks toward some form of price-level or
inflation targeting. In adopting this approach, central banks are
implicitly changing the relative importance of output and inflation
variability in their objective function. The robustness of the policy
rule, however, may depend on the shape of the output-inflation variability
trade-off. The data indicate that this trade-off is extremely steep:
small decreases in inflation variability are associated with very
large increases in output variability. This finding suggests that
pure inflation targeting may have very undesirable side effects},

single yardstick to gauge the degree of integration, there is ample
evidence that financial markets in the euro area have some way to
go before national demarcation lines will effectively disappear and
financial market integration is satisfactory. While there has been
a push towards integration from the centre, global developments,
such as advances in information technology, falling communication
costs and standardisation of products, have been the main drivers,
while national policies often acted as an impediment. The integration
of financial markets finally became a policy priority with the adoption
of the FSAP as part of the Cardiff process launched in 1998. For
the European Union to have a fully satisfactory regulatory framework
for financial markets in place in 2005, further efforts are needed.

in Germany and in other European monetary system countries. The results,
while favorable in several respects, cannot finally confirm a particular
German leadership role within the European monetary system. It is
also demonstrated, using cointegration techniques, that purchasing

intraday data into the measurement, modeling and forecasting of daily
and lower frequency return volatilities and return distributions.
Most procedures for modeling and forecasting financial asset return
volatilities, correlations, and distributions rely on potentially
restrictive and complicated parametric multivariate ARCH or stochastic
volatility models. Use of realized volatility constructed from high-frequency
intraday returns, in contrast, permits the use of traditional time-series
methods for modeling and forecasting. Building on the theory of continuous-time
arbitrage-free price processes and the theory of quadratic variation,
we develop formal links between realized volatility and the conditional
covariance matrix. Next, using continuously recorded observations
for the Deutschemark/Dollar and Yen/Dollar spot exchange rates covering
more than a decade, we find that forecasts from a simple long-memory
Gaussian vector autoregression for the logarithmic daily realized
volatilities perform admirably compared to a variety of popular daily
ARCH and more complicated high-frequency models. Moreover, the vector
autoregressive volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal-normal
mixture distribution implied by the theoretically and empirically
grounded assumption of normally distributed standardized returns,
produces well-calibrated density forecasts of future returns, and
correspondingly accurate quantile predictions. Our results hold promise
for practical modeling and forecasting of the large covariance matrices
relevant in asset pricing, asset allocation and financial risk management
applications.},

abstract = {This paper argues that, in studying the monetary policy transmission
process, more emphasis should be given to the systematic portion
of policy behavior and correspondingly less to random shocks--basically
because shocks account for a very small fraction of policy-instrument
variability. Analysis of the effects of the systematic part of policy
requires structural modeling, rather than VAR procedures, because
the latter do not give rise to behavioral relationships that can
plausibly be regarded as policy-invariant. By use of an illustrative
open-economy structural model based on optimizing analysis, and considering
variants, the paper characterizes the effects of policy parameter
settings by means of impulse response functions and root-mean-square
statistics for target errors. Different models give different answers
to questions about the effects of systematic policy, so procedures
for scrutinizing model specification are essential. In this regard,
it is argued that vector autocorrelation functions, augmented by
variance statistics for each of a model's variables, seem more promising
than impulse response functions because the latter require shock
identification, which is inherently a difficult process.},

structure and insurance arrangements for non-local depositors under
the two representations have a crucial impact on regulators' behaviour.
We show that branch representation leads to a more lenient regulation
for the home unit (the unit of incorporation) than subsidiary representation.
Regulation of the foreign unit can be softer or tougher in branch
MNBs depending on the prospect of the home unit. We examine how intervention
of a regulator in charge of a given bank's unit changes with the
information received about the foreign units. We discuss the effect
of lobbying activity and international resources transfers on its
regulation.},

abstract = {he booming Dutch mortgage market and the development of a promising
secondary mortgage market in the Netherlands stress the need for
an accurate mortgage prepayment model that incorporates typical Dutch
market and contract characteristics. One of those typical Dutch features
prescribes that each calendar year the mortgagor is allowed to prepay
penalty-free 10 to 20 percent of the original loan amount. As a consequence,
Dutch mortgagees suffer a loss when borrowers prepay their loans.
This risk, once again, underlines the importance of a prepayment
model that focuses on the Dutch market. To derive such model we use
historical data on mortgages originated between January 1989 and
June 1999. We estimate separate models for two popular redemption
types: savings mortgages and interest-only mortgages. In both models
we allow for suboptimal prepayment behaviour. The results clearly
indicate that prepayment rates depend on interest rates and the age
of the mortgage contract. Moreover, Dutch prepayment rates peak in
the month December.},

is small relative to the variability of the productivity and fiscal
trends, so inflation accounts for little of the movements in real

significant impact on direct international competition between European
insurance markets, until there is standardization of insurance law.
However, the tightly regulated markets will become more like the
loosely regulated UK market. The paper evaluates this outcome and
concludes that the European Commission's policy may thereby have
improved the welfare of insurance buyers in the previously highly
regulated countries such as Germany. The paper also uses efficiency-frontier
estimation to compare the dispersion of firm efficiencies in the
German and British life insurance market. The results support the

abstract = {Currently, there is no regulatory capital requirement that accounts
for market risks in banks' trading accounts. Bank regulators are
considering a capital charge for such risks based directly on risk
estimates from banks' internal models typically used to measure one-day
exposures. While an improvement over an earlier proposal that would
rely on a regulatory risk measurement system, the internal models
approach has significant drawbacks. The models are not appropriate
for estimating trading account market risk exposure over a relatively
lengthy period of interest to regulators and it is extremely difficult
to validate the risk estimate a bank reports. These difficulties
are eliminated in an alternative approach developed in this paper,
referred to as a {\#}pre-commitment{\#} approach. Under this alternative
approach, the bank pre-commits to a maximum loss exposure over a
fixed subsequent period that takes into account risk management and
trading objectives and allocates capital to cover that exposure.
The regulator determines the likelihood of the bank's market trading
losses exceeding its capital allocation through the incentive effects
of capital penalties or fines imposed in the event of a violation
of the commitment.},

abstract = {This paper studies the behaviour of Dutch banks. We test the adjustment
of banks' balance sheets in times of monetary policy changes during
the period 1957-1991. As a reaction to a policy change, banks basically
have two alternatives to adjust their net money creation: (1) sell
securities in public capital markets, and/or issue long-term liabilities,
and (2) change domestic loan supply. If banks opt for the latter
a lending channel may be relevant, even in a small open economy with
a fixed exchange rate and a high degree of international capital
mobility. We test for the effectiveness of both indirect and direct
instruments of monetary policy. It turns out that in case of changes
in the official interest rate, the volume of bank loans is not affected
and that banks display a kind of buffer-stock behaviour by diminishing
their publicly traded assets. In situations with quantity restrictions
on the growth of net money creation, however, the volume of loans
is affected significantly when the quantity restriction is withdrawn
thereby fulfilling a necessary condition for the bank lending channel
to be effective.},

boom created by expansionary monetary policy is associated with improved
conditions for the poor in the short run. The cross-section evidence
from a large sample of countries, however, shows that low inflation

of the poor in the long run. Both the short-run and long-run relationships
are quantitatively large, statistically significant, and robust.
But because the cyclical effects of monetary policy are inherently
temporary, we conclude that monetary policy that aims at low inflation

of unemployment. We examine what effect uncertainty has on the use
of NAIRU in policy. Uncertainty about the level of NAIRU does not
imply that monetary policy should react less to the NAIRU gap. However,
uncertainty about the effect of the NAIRU gap on inflation does require
adjustments to the policy reaction function. Also, as in Brainard
(1967), uncertainty about the effect of the monetary policy instrument
on the NAIRU gap reduces the magnitude of the policy response. We
estimate a simple NAIRU gap model for the United States to obtain
quantitative measures of uncertainty and to assess how these measures
affect our view of the policy reaction function.},

@article{Razin1997,
abstract = {A common feature for developing countries that have experienced a
sharp drop in inflation without large output losses is the extensive
use of capital controls. This study shows that capital controls significantly
improve the sacrifice ratio. This element contributes to the explanation
of small output losses during disinflations, in addition to the high
inflation mean and large nominal output variability in the pre-stabilization
phase. A useful concept for disinflation episodes is the sacrifice
ratio; the percentage decline in the rate of unemployment with 1{\%}
fall in the rate of inflation. The lower this ratio the less painful
is disinflation. The new classical approach, pioneered by Lucas (1973),
emphasized the variability of nominal GNP growth as a main determinant
of the trade-off. The argument is based on the real-nominal confusion
of price and output setters, so that agents will be more likely to
treat shocks as nominal when the variability of nominal GNP increases.
In contrast, the new Keynesian approach, as in Ball, Mankiw and Romer
(1988), emphasized the menu costs determinants of the trade-off.
That is, in the presence of fixed costs of changing prices, the Phillips
curve is expected to be steeper, the higher is the expected rate
of inflation, since with higher expected inflation and more frequent
price changes, nominal shocks will have smaller real effects.},

traditional commercial banking activities of deposit-taking and lending?
We begin by observing that since banks often lend via commitments,
or credit lines, their lending and deposit-taking may be two manifestations
of the same primitive function: the provision of liquidity on demand.
After all, once the decision to extend a line of credit has been
made, it is really nothing more than a checking account with overdraft
privileges. This observation leads us to argue that there will naturally
be synergies between the two activities, to the extent that both
require banks to hold large volumes of liquid assets (cash and securities)
on their balance sheets: if deposit withdrawals and commitment takedowns
are imperfectly correlated, the two activities can share any deadweight
costs of holding the liquid assets. We develop this idea with a simple
model, and then use a variety of data to test the model's empirical
implications.},

policy had not already been established. Distinctions between different
nominal anchors can be exaggerated. Any credit crunch owed more to
micro distortions than to tight money. Initial stabilization did
not always precede the resumption of growth, but there is little
evidence that more gradual transition would have made disinflation
easier. Thereafter, countries usually experienced large capital inflows
whatever the ostensible exchange-rate regime. Fiscal tightening and
more exchange-rate flexibility offer a sounder eventual response.
Poor incentives and corporate governance in banks should have been
anticipated: subsequent improvements were slow and costly. Large

budget constraints through which the price mechanism could improve
efficiency.},

difficult. For example, regulatory changes which appear comprehensive
may have little impact on the functioning of the capital market if
they fail to lead to foreign portfolio inflows. In contrast to the
usual practice of documenting the timing of regulatory changes, we
specify a reduced-form model for a number of financial time-series
(for example, equity returns and dividend yields) and search for
a common break in the process generating the data. In addition, we
estimate a confidence interval for the break. Information on a variety
of financial and macroeconomic indicators is employed to interpret
the results and to identify the likely date the equity market becomes
financially integrated with world capital markets. We find endogenous
break dates that are very accurately estimated but do not always
correspond closely to dates of official capital market reforms. After
the break, stock markets are on average larger and more liquid than
before; returns are more volatile and more highly correlated with
the world market return, dividend yields are lower and credit ratings
improve. This paper is available},

@article{Clark1997,
abstract = {The objective of the paper is to reconsider the issue of nonlinearity
of the Phillips curve and to underscore its importance for olicymaking.
A true Phillips curve implies that the relationship between inflation
(adjusted for inflation expectations) and excess demand is asymmetric:
a given amount of unemployment below the nonaccelerating inflation
rate of unemployment (NAIRU) generates more inflation than the same
amount of unemployment above the NAIRU lowers it. This asymmetry
implies an important role for stabilization policy that is absent
from linear models of the unemployment-inflation process. In particular,
there can be significant gains from preventing an overheating of
the economy, since the gains when unemployment is below the NAIRU
are more than offset by the increase in unemployment needed to stabilize
inflation. Moreover, convexity in the Phillips curve by itself (abstracting
from inflation adjustment arising from forward-looking expectations
and credibility effects) will result in higher cumulative unemployment
costs, the faster is the pace of disinflation. The paper briefly
reviews the history of the Phillips curve and the theoretical basis
for nonlinearity. It argues that the importance of nonlinearity in
the original work of Phillips and Lipsey was lost in subsequent analyses
that focused on explaining shifts in the curve. The paper then provides
a derivation of the Phillips relationship, showing that the curvature
reflects a structural parameter that links in a nonlinear manner
the level of the real wage to the unemployment rate. The paper also
shows that convexity in the Phillips curve implies that there is
an important distinction between the NAIRU and the natural rate of
unemployment that must be taken into account in estimation. Finally,
estimated equations for the U.S. Phillips curve are used to calculate
the unemployment costs of overheating and rapid deflation in linear
and nonlinear models of the Phillips relationship.},

and the European monetary union (EMU) on the German banking sector.
As a main result, the introduction of the EMU can be assessed as
more important for the German banking system than the SMP because
of the relative liberal conditions prior to the SMP. To maintain
or enhance profitability in an environment of decreasing margins,
all banks will increase their efforts to reduce costs. On the product
side, the disintermediation process is expected to speed up. As a
consequence, the traditional system of universal banks could be somewhat
changed: A partial retreat of savings as well as cooperative banks
from investment banking, accompanied by increasing market shares
in the branch-based retail business. For commercial banks, the consultation-intense
investment business is very attractive. On the retail sector, a specialization
on direct banking allows for additional customers from abroad as
well as for high growth rates in the brokerage business.},

banking crises (three Latin American countries, the Baltics, and

and the factors that determine their impact. It also reviews the
monetary policy response to the crises, including the use of monetary
instruments and changes in monetary targets. The impact of banking
crises on monetary and credit aggregates, and eventually on inflation,
appears to depend on the origin of the crisis and on the country's
underlying characteristics prior to the crisis, such as the exchange
rate regime, the degree of dollarization, and the stability of money
demand. The structure of the banking system and related institutional
characteristics.for example, the deposit insurance scheme and the
lender-of-last-resort mechanism in place.also play a role in determining
the effects of a banking crisis. Monetary and credit instability,
coupled with changes in the nature of monetary aggregates, complicate
monetary management. Monetary instruments may need to be redesigned
in light of this instability, in favor of faster-reacting instruments
such as open market operations. Additional indicators of the monetary
stance, such as asset price and exchange rate movements, may need
to be introduced. If a crisis is systemic, monetary targets will
probably need to be set and reviewed more frequently.},

practice of monetary policy have changed dramatically since 1971-1973,
when the rational expectations revolution was beginning and the Bretton
Woods system was crumbling. The present paper considers whether the
various changes that have taken place were influenced primarily by
economic theory or by empirical evidence-or by a combination of the
two. Monetary economics, like macroeconomics more generally, passed
through the rational expectations period into one dominated by real
business cycle (RBC) analysis, which denies monetary policy any significant
role in the generation or the dampening of cyclical fluctuations
in crucial real variables. Recently, however, the analysis of monetary
policy by both academic and central bank economists has been increasingly
conducted in small quantitative structural models that combine the
optimizing aspect of RBC analysis with various assumptions implying
real effects of monetary policy actions due to slow adjustment of
nominal prices. These models therefore attempt to combine rather
strict theoretical discipline with features that permit an enhanced
degree of empirical veracity. It is apparent, accordingly, that both
theoretical and empirical analysis have been essential in bringing
about alterations in monetary policy analysis between 1971-1973 and
1998.},

abstract = {Those who believe stricter restrictions on allowable bank activities
will limit risk-taking behavior may be surprised to learn that in
countries where bank activities are restricted, the likelihood of
a banking crisis may be greater. Costly bank failures in the past
two decades have focused attention on the need to find ways to improve
the performance of different countries' financial systems. Belief
is overwhelming that financial systems can be improved but there
is little empirical evidence to support any specific advice about
regulatory and supervisory reform. With scant cross-country comparisons
of financial regulatory and supervisory systems, economists cannot
decide how to correct incentives and moral hazard problems in developing
economies - whether, for example, to require higher (and more narrowly
defined) capital-to-asset ratios, to mandate stricter definition
and disclosure of nonperforming loans, to require that subordinated
debt be issued, or to install world-class supervision. Proposed reforms
usually involve changes in financial regulations and supervisory
standards, but many pressing questions about reform remain unanswered.
Making use of a new database, Barth, Caprio, and Levine come up with
brief answers to three key questions: Do countries with relatively
weak governments and bureaucratic systems impose harsher regulatory
restrictions on bank activities? Yes. Do countries with more restrictive
regulatory regimes have poorly functioning banking systems. No- or
at least the evidence is mixed. Do countries with more restrictive
regulatory systems have less probability of suffering a banking crisis?
No. In fact, the reverse is true. In countries where banks' securities
activities are restricted, the likelihood of a banking crisis is
greater, other things being equal.},

van de literatuur op het gebied van stabiliteit: waarom zijn banken

technologische veranderingen, institutionele wijzigingen en disintermediatie.
Deze trends hebben invloed op de inde vorige twee hoofdstukken beschreven

gegeven voor de empirische analyses in de volgende hoofdstukken.
Nu zal het gebeuren, denk je. Het raawerk kent 4 stappen Het probleem
van deze studie is dat hij 20 jaar te laat komt. Toendertijd was
het argument dat een goed renderende bank een stabiele bank was en
daarmee bijdroeg aan een stabiel bankwezen een geaccepteerd argument.
Tegenwoordig is dit argument in ongenade gevallen. De regelgeving
die op dit moment van kracht is, is gericht op het door de banken
goed in laten schatten en beheersen van de risico's (eisen tav procedures
en controls) en in de pricing van het risico alle relevante factoren
te laten meewegen. Deze regelgeving is niet altijd perfect en kan
daardoor onbedoelde effecten hebben op concurentieverhoudingen. De
geest is echter niet om de als belangrijkste de concurentieverhoudingen
aan te passen en daardoor financiele stabiliteit te bevorderen. Hiermee
wordt het probleem aanmerkelijk minder relevant. Zie ook commentaar

abstract = {Previous studies have analyzed how European Monetary Union (EMU) is
likely to affect exchange rate variability by focusing on the game-theoretic
interactions of monetary authorities or fiscal authorities or both.
This paper instead emphasizes the role of the sectoral dimension
of international macroeconomic adjustment. It develops a three-country,
three-good, factor-specific model of trade in which to investigate
the short-run adjustment to demand and supply shocks in the presence
of wage rigidities. This framework allows comparisons, for each type
of shock, of the response of the exchange rate of the monetary union
currency (versus an external currency) with the response of a weighted
average of the bilateral exchange rates of each of the two candidates
for the union (vis-{\`{a}}-vis the outside one). Three types of exchange
rate weights are considered in the comparisons: country-size weights,
trade weights, and equal weights. Whether EMU increases or reduces
exchange rate variability is shown to depend on the relative importance
of different types of shocks (demand or supply), on both the sizes
and the specialization patterns of the countries forming the union,
and on the weights that are assumed to be relevant for the comparator
basket. The analysis is first carried out under the assumption that
money supplies are exogenous. It is then extended to the case of
optimizing monetary policies that attach quadratic losses to both
inflation and employment variability. For comparisons based on country
size or trade weights, the assumptions about monetary policy do not
affect the qualitative nature of the results. Thus, in contrast to
conjectures by Kenen (1995), Bergsten (1997), and others, the analysis
suggests that optimization of policy objectives does not necessarily
imply that EMU will lead to greater exchange rate variability.},

abstract = {Under the European Monetary Union (EMU), member countries will be
subject to common monetary policy shocks. Given the diversity in
the economic and financial structures across the EMU economies, these
common monetary shocks can be reasonably expected to have different
effects. Little is known about what differences might arise, however,
given the absence of any historical experience in Europe with a common
currency. An alternative approach is to draw upon the historical
experience of monetary policy's impacts on sub-national regions in
the United States. Like the countries of the EMU, U.S. states and
regions differ in industry mix and financial composition, while at
the same time, they employ a common currency. Thus, the lessons learned
from the U.S. experience provide valuable information about the potentially
varied effects of a common monetary policy across EMU economies.
In this paper, the authors use earlier findings to construct an index
that ranks EMU countries by their likely sensitivity to a common
monetary shock. The index indicates that countries fall into one
of three groups: Finland, Ireland, and Spain are likely to be most
responsive to monetary policy shocks; France, Italy, and the Netherlands
will have a relatively small response; and Austria, Belgium, Portugal,
Germany, and Luxembourg are likely to have a response close to the
EMU average.},

credit cycle, Mitchell's statistical approach, and Persons's business
barometers; the entrance of random shocks into business cycle theory;
and Tinbergen and macrodynamic models. Discusses the evolution of
market demand analysis, focusing on the narrowing of the data-theory
gap in demand analysis and the evolution of identification questions.
Examines the development of formal models in econometrics, especially
errors-in-variables and errors-in-equations models and Haavelmo's
probability model. An outgrowth of the author's doctoral dissertation
at the London School of Economics (1984). Morgan is a Lecturer in
the Department of Economic History at the London School of Economics.

Kingdom and the United States) for the period 1972-1992.The elasticity
of inflation with respect to central bank independence is estimated
and we calculate the fraction of the covariance between the mean
and the variance of inflation that can be explained by their common
association with central bank independence.We check the robustness
of our results by looking at four indices of central bank independence,
two subperiods and by including control variables.We find that central
bank independence lowers the mean and variance of inflation but has
no effect on the mean and variance of output growth.},

judgment, behavior, and well- being, it can teach us important facts
about how humans differ from traditional economic assumptions. In
this essay I discuss a selection of psychological findings relevant
to economics. Standard economics assumes that each person has stable,
well-defined preferences, and that she rationally maximizes those
preferences. Section 2 considers what psychological research teaches
us about the true form of preferences, allowing us to make economics
more realistic within the rational-choice framework. Section 3 reviews
research on biases in judgment under uncertainty; because those biases
lead people to make systematic errors in their attempts to maximize
their preferences, this research poses a more radical challenge to
the economics model. The array of psychological findings reviewed
in Section 4 points to an even more radical critique of the economics
model: Even if we are willing to modify our familiar assumptions
about preferences, or allow that people make systematic errors in
their attempts to maximize those preferences, it is sometimes misleading
to conceptualize people as attempting to maximize well-defined, coherent,
or stable preferences.},

to banks as a source of investment mainly because banks are good
at helping them through times of financial distress. This financial
flexibility is costly since banks face costs of capital themselves

this intermediation cost, firms may turn to bond or equity financing,
but bonds imply an inefficient liquidation cost and equity an informational
dilution cost. We show that in equilibrium the riskier firms prefer
bank loans, the safer ones tap the bond markets, and the ones in
between prefer to issue both equity and bonds. This segmentation

in foreign exchange to make non-interest-bearing deposits with their
central bank, represent the best option for successfully traversing
the treacherous Stage II. Check whether German prices have any influence

abstract = {In the early 1980s, economists tested inflation forecasts and found
that the forecasts were very bad. Either the surveys didn't capture
forecasters' expectations, or forecasters didn't have rational expectations.
However, the sample period being examined consisted mostly of data
from the volatile 1970s, when forecasting was extremely difficult.
The question is: If we run the same types of tests that were performed
15 years ago on an updated sample, will we find the same problems
with the forecasts? This paper finds that much of the empirical work
from 15 years ago does not stand the test of time. The forecast errors
from the surveys aren't nearly as bad today as they were in the 1970s.
However, some problems remain in the forecasts. It appears to be
possible to improve inflation forecasts over some sample periods
using bias regressions, and the forecasts don't pass all tests for
optimality.},

abstract = {We use a version of the Fuhrer-Moore model to study the effects of
expectations and central bank credibility on the economy's dynamic
transition path during a disinflation. Simulations are compared under
four different specifications of the model that vary according to
the way that expectations are formed (rational versus adaptive) and
the degree of central bank credibility (full versus partial). In
general, the various specifications exhibit qualitatively similar
behavior and can reasonably approximate the trend movements in U.S.
macrovariables during the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s.
However, the specification with adaptive expectations and partial
credibility is the only one to capture the temporary rise in the
long-term nominal interest rate observed in U.S. data at the start
of the disinflation. Our simulations also show that incremental reductions
in the sacrifice ratio are largest at the low end of the credibility
range, suggesting that a central bank may face diminishing returns
in its efforts to enhance credibility.},

monopoly unions. It is assumed that the senior union members are

face a lower unemployment risk than the junior members. Consequently,
the unions' median voters are senior and set nominal wages that imply
involuntary unemployment on part of the juniors. Thus, equilibrium
unemployment is too high from a social welfare point of view. Nevertheless,
an independent central bank is found not to produce an inflation
bias because it is accountable to the majority of the population,
which is not involuntarily unemployed. In contrast, government-dependence
leads to an inflation bias and a higher variability of inflation,
but has an ambiguous effect on employment variability. The reason
is that democratic elections are about more than one policy issue,
which is shown to give rise to political uncertainty about the monetary
policy policy preferences of the elected government.},

that the surveys reflect an intermediate degree of rationality: Expectations

optimal bank response to (1) past and proposed changes in capital
requirements, (2) changes in regulatory monitoring intensity, and

@article{Clark1998,
abstract = {This paper compares two approaches for assessing the extent to which
a country.s real effective exchange rate is consistent with economic
fundamentals. One approach defines the Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange
Rate (FEER) as that real exchange rate which is consistent with macroeconomic
balance, which is identified as the rate that brings the current
account into equality with the underlying or sustainable capital
account, where the determinants of both the current and capital accounts
have been set at their full employment values. By contrast, the other
approach involves the direct econometric analysis of a model of the
behavior of the real effective exchange rate.consequently called
the Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER). The BEER approach
produces a measure of misalignment that is different from the FEER,
as it relates to the deviation between the actual exchange rate and
the value given by the estimated equilibrium relationship. However,
the BEER approach also requires judging whether the economic fundamentals
that determine exchange rate behavior are themselves at sustainable
or equilibrium levels. We illustrate the BEER approach with the estimation
of equations for the real effective exchange rates for the German
mark, the Japanese yen, and the U.S. dollar using cointegration methods.
This has the novel feature of providing a meaningful interpretation
of multiple cointegrating vectors: one that embodies four long-run
determinants of the exchange rate (the terms of trade, relative price
on nontraded to traded goods, the stock of net foreign assets, and
a proxy for the risk premium) and another that involves the short-run
effect of the interest rate differential. The estimated BEERs, including
those generated with calibrated values of the explanatory variables
using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, are used to shed light on the
consistency of the three exchange rates with economic fundamentals,
and are also compared with FEERs estimated by Williamson (1994).},

of opportunistic political business cycles in German data. Inferring
from Vaubel (1993, 1997) one could argue, however, that at least
in the case of monetary policy the results are seriously flawed from
the onset, because an independent central bank such as the German
Bundesbank will support the government only when it shares its partisan
views. Vaubel has not presented parametric empirical evidence in
support of his hypothesis. We show that the application of time series
analysis yields results that clearly run counter to the hypothesis.
Evidence on voting behaviour from the central bank council minutes
points in the same direction. It appears perhaps paradoxically that
an opportunistic government is better off facing an ideologically
opposing Bundesbank council majority than a supportive one before
elections.},

resulting in an enhanced rather than reduced degree of instability
in the banking and financial system. Despite this possible shortcoming,
we believe that sensible risk based weighting of capital requirements
is a step in the right direction. The current risk based bucketing
proposal, which is tied to external agency ratings, or possibly to
internal bank ratings, however, lacks a sufficient degree of granularity.
In particular, lumping A and BBB (investment grade corporate borrowers)
together with BB and B (below investment grade borrowers) severely
misprices risk within that bucket and calls, at a minimum, for that
bucket to be split into two. We examine the default loss experience
on corporate bonds for the period 1981-1999 and propose a revised
weighting system which more closely resembles the actual loss experience

employing strong assumptions about real interest rate behaviour.
The inflation forecasts of the ITS also seem at least as good at
forecasting future changes in inflation as forecasts derived from
macroeconometric models. These characteristics of the ITS and its
timeliness tend to make its inflation forecasts a useful addition
to policy analysis. Because the real term structure tends to underpredict
the level of future real interest rates, index-linked bonds have
proved, ex post, to be cheap funding for the UK government. But we
cannot be sure whether this underprediction results from an inflation
risk premium or expectational error and also cannot know whether

prices, focusing on model stability and the forecasting performance
of time-varying parameter models. In bivariate models, producer price
inflation consistently Granger-causes consumer price inflation in-sample
but fails to improve out-of-sample forecasts of consumer price inflation.
The tests of Nyblom (1989), Andrews (1993), and Andrews and Ploberger
(1994) indicate instability pervades the bivariate models. Allowing
for a simple form of instability, however, fails to improve the predictive
power of producer prices. Even in models using the stochastic coefficients
formulation developed by Cooley and Prescott (1973(a), 1973(b), 1976),
among others, producer prices do not help to forecast consumer prices.},

abstract = {This paper tests whether the tendency of third rating agencies to
assign higher ratings than Moody's and Standard {\&} Poor's results
from more lenient standards or sample selection bias. More lenient
standards might result from incentives to satisfy issuers who are,
in fact, the purchasers of the ratings. Selection bias might be important
because issuers that expect a low rating from a third agency are
unlikely to request one. Our analysis of a broad sample of corporate
bond ratings at year-end 1993 reveals that, although sample selection
bias appears important, it explains less than half the observed difference
in average ratings. The paper also investigates why bond issuers
seek ratings in addition to those of Moody's and Standard {\&} Poor's.
Contrary to expectations, the probability of obtaining a third rating
is not found to be related to levels of ex ante uncertainty over
firm default probabilities. In particular, a firm's decision to obtain
a third rating appears unrelated to its Moody's and Standard {\&} Poor's
ratings or the amount of disagreement between them. Instead, the
most important determinants of the decision are a firm's age and
size. The results should be of interest to investors and financial
market regulators who generally use the ratings of different agencies
as if they correspond to similar levels of default risk. In addition,
our findings raise a number of questions about the certification
role of rating agencies and about the strength of the rating agencies'
incentives to maintain a reputation for high quality (accurate) ratings.},

from the paper. First, even with optimal targets or contracts, central
bank independence may not always be desirable because central banks
may have distorted preferences relative to society. Second, if the

abstract = {Major differences between national financial systems might make a
common monetary policy difficult. As within Europe, Germany and the
United Kingdom differ most with respect to their financial systems,
the present paper addresses its topic under the assumption that the
United Kingdom is already a part of EMU. Employing a comprehensive
concept of a financial system, the author shows that there are indeed
profound differences between the national financial systems of Germany
and the United Kingdom. But he argues that these differences are
not likely to create great problems for a common monetary policy.
In the context of the present paper, one important difference between
the two financial systems refers to the structure of the respective
financial sector and, as a consequence, to the strength with which
a given monetary policy impulse set by the central bank is passed
on to the financial sector. The other important difference refers
to the typical relationship between the banks and the business sector
in each country which determines to what extent the financial sectors
and especially the banks pass on pressure exerted on them by a monetary
policy authority to their clients in their national business sector.
In Germany, the central bank has a stronger influence on the financial
sector than in England, while, for systemic reasons, German banks
tend to soften monetary policy pressures on their customers more
than British banks do. As far as the transmission of a restrictive
monetary policy of the ECB to the real economy is concerned, these
two differences tend to offset each other. This is good news for
the advocates of a monetary union as it eases the task of the ECB
when it comes to determining the strength of its monetary policy
measures},

@article{Aziz1997,
abstract = {Why some developing countries grow rapidly and others do not is one
of the most compelling questions in economics. Some researchers argue
that good economic policies play an important role and can contribute
to fast growth. Williamson (1993) even describes a set of policies
that he calls the .Washington Consensus,. promoting open trade, deregulation,
and liberalized financial markets, that supposedly hasten the pace
of economic growth the most. Other researchers, however, claim that
growth rates among developing countries are determined primarily
by factor endowments and natural proclivities, such as a country.s
ratio of investment to GDP. They argue that there is little that
Washington-Consensus-type policies can do. This paper argues that
critical policy complementarities are missed on both sides in this
debate. Policy complementarity refers to the mutually reinforcing
benefits of policies that seem to be jointly critical for fast growth.
Such a policy package seems to work largely by creating a good environment
for investment and might include, for example, openness to trade,
policies to secure macroeconomic stability, and measures to limit
the degree of government intervention in an economy. Policy complementarity
is shown to be statistically important and robust in helping to explain
growth outcomes. Among developing countries that had the most complementary
policies, nearly four out of five posted either medium or fast growth.
This paper concludes that, while the types of policies referred to
in the Washington Consensus are generally the right ones for developing
countries to pursue, progress along a multifaceted set of policy
dimensions is more critical than sometimes appears to be thought,
especially as the world economy becomes more globalized. This finding
suggests that efforts to sequence economic reforms in developing
countries could lead to outcomes that are less successful than is
desirable.},

optimal management of financial crises. Explores the role of renegotiation
in financial relationships. Suggests why firms rely so heavily on
internal finance and how it may be optimal for shareholders to allow
managers a significant degree of autonomy. Compares the performance
of markets and intermediaries at financing new technologies. Models
the costs of using markets, assuming that individuals invest directly
in markets. Analyzes the possibility that an intermediary could help
an individual to overcome the informational barriers to using sophisticated

have helped many developing and transition economies develop more
stable and transparent policy regimes, and their commitments in no
way compromise their ability to pursue sound macroeconomic and regulatory
policies. But the Asian and Latin American participants, especially,
held back on commitments to financial liberalization. And there was
less emphasis on introducing competition by allowing new entry than
on allowing (or maintaining) foreign equity participation and protecting
the position of incumbents. Mattoo analyzes the results of the financial
services negotiations under the World Trade Organization's General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). He shows that the negotiations
have contributed to more stable and transparent policy regimes in
many developing and transition economies and that the commitments
in no way compromise the countries' ability to pursue sound macroeconomic
and regulatory policies. But even though the number of countries
that participated in the eventual agreement was impressive, the liberalizing
content of commitments was in many cases quite limited. Numerical
estimates suggest that in general the African and Eastern European
participants made much more liberal commitments than the Asian and
Latin American participants. On the whole, the outcome probably reflects
how each participant balances the benefit of unilateral commitments
against the benefit of retaining bargaining chips for future multisectoral
negotiations. Two aspects of the outcome cause concern: There has
been less emphasis on introducing competition by allowing new entry
than on allowing (or maintaining) foreign equity participation and
protecting the position of incumbents. Where it was deemed infeasible
to introduce competition immediately, participants have taken little
advantage of the GATS to lend credibility to liberalization programs
by precommitting to future market access. This paper - a product

rate risk is the interest rate risk of liquid retail deposits. In
this study, estimates are developed for the interest rate sensitivity
of the value of interest-bearing checkable deposits (OCD's) and savings
deposits defined to include MMDA's and other savings accounts. These
interest rate sensitivities are measured by the percentage change
in the value of the deposit liability due to a change in market interest
rates which, for a permanent rate shock and hence parallel yield
curve shift, represent the deposits {\#}duration.{\#} The value of the
deposit liability is equal to the deposit balance net of the present
value of economic profits earned on the liability. Because deposit
rates adjust upward to market rates more slowly than downward, the
interest rate sensitivity of the economic profits from liquid deposit
accounts tends to be greater when deposit rates are rising than when
they are falling. As a consequence, durations tend to be relatively
large when deposit rates are moving up and small when deposit rates
are moving down. Durations are estimated for permanent shocks to
market rates for aggregated deposit categories and for individual
banks. The consequences for deposit interest rate sensitivities are
further examined for stochastic, mean-reverting market rates and
nonparallel yield curve shifts.},

a rapid growth in branching activity, much of it geographically dispersed,

between growth, return, and risk. In recent years banks increasingly
have adopted innovative performance metrics based on the concept
of economic profit, rather than accounting earnings, to assist managers
in making such difficult and complex decisions. Banks hope in this
way to elicit better decision-making by managers and also to align
managerial behavior more closely with the interests of shareholders.
This article analyzes the use of economic profit for measuring the
performance of banks, focusing on the allocation of equity capital
to products, customers, and businesses. The author reviews the use
of economic profit to evaluate performance, to price transactions,
and to reward managers. He describes in detail one performance measurement
and incentive system and then goes on to discuss the shortcomings
of performance metrics founded on economic profit, which may distort
banks' investment and operating decision-making. He concludes that
banks need to recognize the ambiguities of such calculations and
be prepared to create and apply multiple specialized performance

abstract = {Literature to date has identified three main aspects of liquidation
time: firm size, asset specificity, and industry concentration. The
present paper unifies the theory behind these three aspects of bankruptcy
costs by treating them as components of a broader option valuation
problem faced by the liquidating trustee. In the options valuation
framework, at time t the trustee may choose to 1) liquidate at current
asset values and incur a known loss, or 2) hold until the next period
t+1 at a positive opportunity cost. The trustee may not sell in the
current period if expected asset price growth is sufficiently large.
Expectations of asset price growth are based on previous asset price
growth and asset price volatility, which are related to firm size,
asset specificity, and industry concentration. Testing the hypothesized
asset price relationships on FDIC failed bank liquidation data with
OLS, three-stage least squares, and duration specifications yields
the appropriate results. Furthermore, it appears that liquidation
time alone can be used as an effective second order proxy for asset
value growth where market value estimates are unavailable.},

abstract = {We present a model of a {\#}soft{\#} exchange rate target zone and interpret
it as a stylized description of the post-August 1993 ERM. Our central
bank targets a moving average of the current and past exchange rates,
rather than the exchange rate's current level, thus allowing the
rate to move within wide margins in the short run, but within narrow
margins in the long run. For realistic parameters, soft target zones
are significantly less vulnerable to speculative attacks than {\#}hard{\#}
target zones. These predictions are consistent with the ERM's experience
and the abatement of speculative pressure in European markets since
the bands' widening in 1993.},

@article{Pigott1998,
abstract = {This paper examines several key issues concerning the implications
for monetary policy of the achievement of low inflation in OECD countries
during the 1990s. In particular, the analysis considers whether there
have been improvements in monetary policy transmission mechanisms
that lower inflation vulnerabilities, or make it easier to reduce
inflation pressures when they arise; and the further benefits and
costs likely to be involved in lowering inflation to zero, or in
attempting to maintain a stable price level. The analysis supports
three main observations. First, there have been significant changes,
particularly in inflation expectations and in monetary policy frameworks,
that should help in containing inflation and lowering the costs of
doing so. However, except in the United States and the United Kingdom,
there is little evidence yet of fundamental changes in wage and price
behaviour underlying the flexibility of labour and product markets;
although it is possible that this reflects insufficient time for
such changes to have become manifest. Second, despite the improvements
that have occurred, the present low inflation environment cannot
be taken for granted. In particular, to maintain that environment,
policy will have to continue to be forward-looking in responding
to prospective inflation pressures before they can accumulate. Third,
the case for lowering inflation further is strongest for those countries
with fairly flexible labour and product markets. In countries where
considerable rigidities remain, the main priorities are to preserve
the low levels of inflation that have been attained while pursuing
structural reforms to improve market functioning.},

@article{Benabou1996,
abstract = {Using two unifying models and an empirical exercise, this paper present
and extends the main theories linking income distribution and growth,
as well as the relevant empirical evidence. The first model integrates
the political economy and imperfect capital markets theories. It
allows for explicit departures from perfect democracy and embodies
the tradeoff between the growth costs and benefits of redistribution
through taxes, land reform or public schooling: such policies simultaneously
depress savings incentives and ease wealth constraints which impede
investment by the poor. The second model is a growth version of the
prisoner's dilemma which captures the essence of theories where sociopolitical
conflict reduces the security of property rights thereby discouraging
accumulation. The economy's growth rate is shown to fall with interest
groups' rent-seeking abilities, as well as with the gap between rich
and poor. It is not income inequality per se that matters, but inequality
in the relative distribution of earnings and political power. For
each of the three channels of political economy, capital markets
and social conflict, the empirical evidence is surveyed and discussed
in conjunction with theoretical analysis. Finally, the possibility
of multiple steady-states leads me to to raise and take up a new
empirical issue: are cross-country differences in inequality permanent,
or gradually narrowing? Equivalently, is there conver- gence not
only in first moments (GDP per capita), but convergence in distribution?},

are affected. Thus, enhanced disclosure can improve the allocation

Financial hedging improves the informativeness of corporate earnings
as a signal of management ability and project quality by eliminating
extraneous noise. Managerial and shareholder incentives regarding
information transmission may differ, however, leading to conflicts
regarding an optimal hedging policy. We show that these incentives
depend on the accounting information made available by the firm.
Under some circumstances, if hedge transactions are not disclosed
(i.e., firms report only aggregate earnings), managers hedge to achieve
greater risk reduction than they would if full disclosure were required.
In these cases, it is optimal for shareholders to request only aggregate
accounting reports.},

Kingdom. It focuses in particular on inflation distortions under
an imperfectly indexed tax system and distortions to money demand.
In the United States, an earlier study by Feldstein found that lowering
inflation by 2 percentage points could generate welfare benefits
of as much as 1{\%} of GDP per year forever. In the United Kingdom,
the benefits are found to be smaller, but still substantial, at 0.2{\%}
of GDP per year. The technique used is based on quantifying the familiar
welfare triangles under a demand curve. The welfare losses are significant
because the interaction of taxes and inflation means that the welfare
losses are trapezia rather than triangles. The paper also takes account
of any welfare loss/gain associated with a change in government revenue.
The paper goes on to perform sensitivity analysis on each of the
key behavioural parameters, and to compare the welfare gains of lower
inflation with the costs of disinflation.},

both today and under the late 19th century gold standard suggests
that important lessons can be learned by looking at past record to
inform current issues. In this article, we draw a fresh picture of
the European gold standard, and use it to derive a number of useful
implications. The paper's basic finding is that the stability of
the European gold standard depended on the stance of the common monetary
policy. Under the gold standard, this stance was disturbingly deflationary
prior to 1895. As a result, debts became exceedingly heavy and monetary
standards crumbled under their weight, not so much because fiscal
policies became looser, but rather because debt burdens became unsustainable
in the wake of continued deflation. Once gold was discovered and
deflation gave way to inflation, real interest rates fell and debt
grew more slowly. This study's clear implication for the EMU zone,
is that stability will hinge on the European Central Bank's (ECB)
policy not being too restrictive.},

paper takes up the challenge of modeling empirical household expectations
data, and shows that a simple, standard model from epidemiology does
a remarkably good job of explaining the deviations of household inflation
and unemployment expectations from the `rational expectations' benchmark.
Furthermore, a microfoundations or `agent-based' version of the model
may be able to explain, in a way that still permits aggregation,
stark rejections of the pure rational expectations framework like
Souleles's (2002) finding that members of different demographic groups

parties for a smooth switch from eleven national currencies to a
single joint currency. A third problems, one that is central for
EMU and to any currency union, lies behind the difficulty of the
transition: the possibility of nationally asymmetric real shocks.
I review that topic in the context of Ireland's recent experience.

Three, already much noted, connected with the provision of lender
of last resort facilities in the euro zone and the framework for
supervising financial institutions. The deficit and debt limits embodies
in the excessive deficits procedure of the Maastrich treaty and the
subsequent Stability and Growth Pact have been justified by the threat
high debts might pose to the stability of the euro zone's financial
markets. I consider the past and prospective fiscal adjustments of
the EMU 11, and suggest these might pose future difficulties for
macroeconomic policy and growth},

the value at risk of a market position. In statistics, extremes of
a random process refer to the lowest observation (the minimum) and
to the highest observation (the maximum) over a given time-period.
Extreme value theory gives some interesting results about the distribution
of extreme returns. In particular, the limiting distribution of extreme
returns observed over a long time-period is largely independent of
the distribution of returns itself. In financial markets, extreme
price movements correspond to market corrections during ordinary
periods, and also to stock market crashes, bond market collapses
or foreign exchange crises during extraordinary periods. An approach
based on extreme values to compute the VaR thus covers market conditions
ranging from the usual environment considered by the existing VaR
methods to the financial crises which are the focus of stress testing.
Univariate extreme value theory is used to compute the VaR of a fully
aggregated position while multivariate extreme value theory is used
to compute the VaR of a position decomposed on risk factors.},

@article{Debelle1996,
abstract = {Central bank independence has emerged at the forefront of political
agendas around the world. A significant part of the impetus for increased
central bank independence derives from the performance of the German
economy under the Bundesbank, but it also comes from the recent theoretical
and empirical literature, which has highlighted the positive association
between lower inflation and increased central bank independence.
The theoretical rationale for increased central bank independence
has developed from the time-consistency model of Barro and Gordon
(1983a, b). That model and most of its successors examine the effect
of central bank independence on inflation and output in isolation
from the actions of other policymakers. The purpose of this paper
is to explicitly model a separate monetary and fiscal authority and
to examine the interaction between the two in determining the macroeconomic
performance of the economy. The model used in this paper highlights
three factors that affect inflation and output in addition to the
central bank's degree of inflation aversion (which is the traditional
definition of central bank independence in the literature). First,
the preferences of the fiscal authority play a key role in determining
the state of the economy; the central bank's preferences are no longer
the sole determining factor. Second, the nature of the policy game
affects the level of inflation and output. The existing literature
has focused on the Nash equilibrium of the policy game. Here the
Stackelberg equilibria are also examined, which may more accurately
reflect the practical relationship between central banks and governments.
Third, the obligations of the two authorities to repay debt affect
the equilibrium outcomes. The model can be solved for the optimal
degree of inflation aversion of the central bank. The optimal inflation
aversion is shown to depend on the preferences of the fiscal authority
and of society and on the institutional structure of the economy.
An increase in the inflation aversion of the central bank, while
always reducing the inflation rate, may reduce welfare because of
its adverse effects on output and government spending. The net welfare
effect is shown to depend on the weights in the welfare functions
of the fiscal authority and society. Thus, increasing the central
bank's inflation aversion is not necessarily a free lunch.},

the expenditure approach, the production approach, and the income
approach. Countries compiling quarterly estimates for GDP often use
some combination of these alternative approaches simultaneously.
This may result in the publication of different measures of quarterly
GDP and discrepancies between these measures. Such discrepancies
are unavoidable, unless reconciliation takes place or the measures
are mutually interdependent. Occasionally, discrepancies between
the various estimates are a cause for concern. For instance, in the
1980s the U.K. Central Statistical Office was severely criticized
for persistently large discrepancies among its quarterly GDP estimates,
and in 1989 a Cabinet Office scrutiny report was published in response
to growing concerns. More recently, attention has been drawn to discrepancies
between the two U.S. quarterly GDP estimates. This paper examines
the problem of discrepancies in an international context. It gives
a general overview of quarterly national accounts compilation methods
and their relative weaknesses and strengths. Subsequently, it discusses
ways in which discrepancy problems can be dealt with in general,
followed by an overview of practices in statistically advanced countries
within the OECD. This analysis is elaborated for those OECD members
that have to deal with discrepancies in their quarterly national
accounts--the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand--and causes and the development of these discrepancies

accounting income may be a biased and noisy signal of economic profit.
Estimation is performed using generalized nonlinear least squares
on a pooled series of cross sections. The results indicate that the
expected rate of adjustment tends to be significantly greater than
zero, although smaller than adjustment speeds found in studies of
nonbank firms. The estimated speed of adjustment for negative profits
is greater than for positive profits; for banks with high profit
rates, the adjustment speed is near zero, implying that supernormal

factors in determining foreign banks' return-on-assets in the period
under study. Capital strength stands out as being the most important
factor influencing foreign bank return on shareholders equity. US
demand also appeared to be important in determining foreign bank
performance but it had no significant impact on growth in commercial
lending. There is also little evidence to suggest that the largest
foreign banks are significantly more profitable than their smaller
counterparts. In general, it appears that capital strength will be
one of the most important factors determining foreign bank performance

tentatively suggest that capital considerations may well outweigh
other factors when foreign bank expansion plans are considered in
the United States especially in the light of the 1997 nationwide

with the 1990-91 recession, particularly in New England, has evoked
claims by many observers of a credit crunch. To overcome the difficulty
in determining whether the observed slow credit growth is a demand
or supply phenomenon, the authors examine a cross-section of banks
in New England that have experienced the same economic downturn,
effectively controlling for changes in demand. They find empirical
support for a capital crunch, whereby poorly capitalized institutions
shrink more than their better-capitalized peers, indicating an independent
role for credit supply.},

Loan growth among banks that are affiliated with a multi-bank holding
company is shown to be less sensitive to the bank's cash flow, capital

coupled with the recent findings of Houston et al. (1997), suggest
that bank holding companies establish internal capital markets in
an attempt to allocate capital among their various subsidiaries.
We also find that affiliated banks are more responsive to local market
conditions than their unaffiliated counterparts. This finding suggests
that despite the concerns raised regarding bank consolidation--affiliated
banks are willing to lend in local markets as long as the opportunities
are there.},

abstract = {Abstract: Credit market conditions play a key role in propagating
shocks in middle income countries (MICs). In particular, shocks to
the spread between domestic and international interest rates have
a strong effect on GDP, and an even stronger effect on domestic credit.
This strong credit channel is associated with a sharp sectorial asymmetry:
the output of the bank-dependent nontradables (N) sector reacts more
strongly than tradables (T) output. This asymmetry, in turn, is associated
with a strong reaction of the real exchange rate --the relative price
between N and T goods. We present a model that reconciles these facts
and leads to a well specified estimation framework. From the equilibrium
we derive structural VARs that allow us to identify shocks to credit
market conditions and trace their effects on the economy. We estimate
these structural VARs for a group of MICs and find evidence of a
strong credit channel. We argue that at the heart of the MIC credit
channel are a deep asymmetry in financing opportunities across N
and T sectors, and a severe currency mismatch. This makes movements
in the real exchange rate the driving element in the amplification
of shocks. Finally, we show that the model's key assumptions are
consistent with evidence gleaned from both firm level and aggregate
data.},

between bank integration and volatility is ambiguous; integration
tends to dampen the impact of bank capital shocks on state activity,
but it amplifies the impact of firm collateral shocks. Empirically,
the net effect has been stabilizing as year-to-year fluctuations
in employment growth within states fall as that state's banks become
better integrated (via holding companies) with banks in other states.
The magnitudes are large, and the effects are most pronounced in
states with relatively undiversified economies. Consistent with our
model, we find the link between economic growth and bank capital
within a state weakens with integration, whereas the link between
growth and housing prices (a possible proxy for firm capital) tends
to increase.},

abstract = {Empirical examinations of capital structure have led some to conclude
that firms are under-levered. Implicit in this argument and much
of the empirical work on leverage is the assumption that the availability
of incremental capital depends solely on the risk of the firm's cash
flows and characteristics of the firm. However, the same market frictions
that make capital structure relevant suggest that firms may be rationed
by lenders, leading some firms to appear to be under-levered relative
to unconstrained firms. We examine this theory, arguing that the
same characteristics that may be associated with firms being rationed
by the debt markets are also associated with financial intermediaries,
opposed to bond markets, being the source of a firm's debt capital.
We find that firms have significantly different leverage ratios based
on whether they have access to public bond markets as measured by
the firm having a debt rating. Although firms with a debt rating
are fundamentally different, these differences do not explain our
findings. Even after controlling for the firm characteristics previously
found to determine observed capital structure and the possible endogeneity
of having a bond rating, we find that firms which are able to raise
debt from public markets have 40 percent more debt.},

development in developed countries over the twentieth century. We
find that, contrary to the predictions of most existing theories,
indicators of financial development do not seem monotonic over time.
In particular, we find that by most measures, countries were more
financially developed in 1913 than in 1980 and that a major reversal
took place between 1913 and 1950. To explain this we outline a simple
theory of the political economy of financial development. Empirically,
our analysis suggests that the forces opposing financial development
will be weaker when a country is open to international trade and
capital flows. We find this to be true both in the cross- section
and over time. In periods of free capital movement world- wide, a
country? level of financial development is directly related to its
openness to trade. Similarly, the low frequency movements of financial
development over time appear to be correlated with the degree to
which capital is mobile world-wide. ,},

price-cost margins in a Cournot and a Bertrand setting. In all cases,
competition is reduced due to shareholding interlocks. As an empirical
example the Dutch financial sector is used. Comparing the case of
shareholding with the case of no-shareholding, the price-cost margins
are found to be up to 2{\%} higher in a Bertrand market, and at least
8{\%} higher in a Cournot market.},

abstract = {It is not common for an entire scholarly literature to be based on
a fallacy, that is, 'on faulty reasoning; misleading or unsound argument'.
The 'fiscal theory of the price level', recently re-developed by
Woodford, Cochrane, Sims and others, is an example of a fatally flawed
research programme. The source of the fallacy is an economic misspecification.
The proponents of the fiscal theory of the price level do not accept
the fundamental proposition that the government's intertemporal budget
constraint is a constraint on the government's instruments that must
be satisfied for all admissible values of the economy-wide endogenous
variables. Instead they require it to be satisfied only in equilibrium.
This economic misspecification has implications for the mathematical
or logical properties of the equilibria supported by models purporting
to demonstrate the properties of the fiscal approach. These include:
overdetermined (internally inconsistent) equilibria; anomalies like
the apparent ability to price things that do not exist; the need
for arbitrary restrictions on the exogenous and predetermined variables
in the government's budget constraint; and anomalous behaviour of
the equilibrium' price sequences, including behaviour that will ultimately
violate physical resource constraints. The issue is of more than
academic interest. Policy conclusions could be drawn from the fiscal
theory of the price level that would be harmful if they influenced
the actual behaviour of the fiscal and monetary authorities. The
fiscal theory of the price level implies that a government could
exogenously fix its real spending, revenue and seigniorage plans,
and that the general price level would adjust the real value of its
contractual nominal debt obligations so as to ensure government solvency.
When reality dawns, the result could be painful fiscal tightening,
government default, or unplanned recourse to the inflation tax.},

@article{Debelle1997,
abstract = {In recent years, an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy
has been adopted by New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Finland,
Sweden, Australia, and Spain (in chronological order). Because the
experience of most of these countries with monetary targeting or
a fixed exchange rate had proved unsatisfactory, this new framework
for the conduct of monetary policy was required. In theory, an inflation
target is relatively straightforward. The central bank forecasts
the future path of inflation; the forecast is compared with the target
inflation rate; the difference between the forecast and the target
determines the required adjustment of the monetary policy instrument.
However, the experience to date of the inflation targeting countries
has identified a number of complex operational issues. This paper
highlights five aspects of the inflation targeting framework: the
assignment of the target, the interaction with other policy goals,
the definition of the target, accountability, and the role of inflation
forecasts. It compares and contrasts the approaches that the countries
have adopted in addressing these issues. As a result, the prerequisites
for an inflation target framework can be distilled from the experience
of these countries. The economic performance to date of the new framework
appears promising. Inflation has been brought down in all seven countries.
However, a downward trend in inflation during this time was a feature
of most industrial countries, and not solely of those that practiced
inflation targeting. Nevertheless, the inflation targeting framework
has proven beneficial in addressing problems caused by lack of credibility
in those countries that have adopted it.},

Although the concentration of derivatives activities in the largest
banks is well known, we know less about other factors underlying
a bank's decision to use derivatives. This article investigates the
financial characteristics of banks that use derivatives and those
that do not. We find that user banks, compared to nonusers, are associated
with riskier capital structures (more notes and debentures and less
equity capital), larger maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities,
greater net loan charge-offs, and lower net interest margins. We
also find that banks, especially smaller ones, benefit from being
associated with bank-holding companies. Finally, our evidence does
not support a regulatory hypothesis in which banks must have stronger

abstract = {From a credit risk perspective, little is known about the distress
factors -- economy-wide or firm-specific -- that are important in
explaining variations in defaultable coupon yields. This paper proposes
and empirically tests a family of credit risk models. Empirically,
we find that firm-specific distress factors play a role (beyond treasuries)
in explaining defaultable coupon bond yields. Credit risk models
that take into consideration leverage and book-to- market are found
to reduce out-of-sample yield fitting errors (for the majority of
firms). Moreover, the empirical evidence suggests that interest rate
risk may be of first-order prominence for pricing and hedging. Measured
by both out-of-sample pricing and hedging errors, the credit risk
models perform relatively better for high grade bonds. Controlling
for credit rating, the model performance is generally superior for
longer maturity bonds compared to its shorter maturity counterparts.
Using equity as an instrument reduces hedging errors. This paper
provides an empirical investigation of credit risk models using observable
economic factors.},

influence on the bank's policy. Full transparency of the central

not in the interest of the bank. Somewhat paradoxically, direct observability

insolvency; from relatively simple cor-rective measures to receivership,

in discussions of bank regulatory policy. The first, that equity
holders prefer more risk to less, derives from a result in option
pricing theory, that an option's value increases monotonically with
the riskiness of the underlying asset. This result is shown to depend
on very restrictive assumptions regarding the underlying assets return
distribution and the type of option being considered. These restrictive
assumptions do not generally obtain in practice. The second rule
of thumb is that bondholders' and deposit insurers' interests are
aligned. The paper shows that, in fact, their interests can diverge
in the sense that bondholders and deposit insurers will not necessarily
agree on the relative riskiness of different banks or bank portfolios.
The conclusion of this paper is that rules of thumb can be misleading.
Furthermore, the concept of risk is shown to be model and agent specific.},

although changing expectations played a role in creating the empirical
failure of the Phillips Curve in the 1970s, supply shocks were at

of accountability are considered. The first one is transparency of
actual monetary policy, the second aspect is the question of who

transparent if there is little uncertainty about the central bankers
preferences. Transparency enhances the responsibility for monetary
policy in the direction of the government. This can be achieved by
making the cost of overriding the central bank lower. The paper shows
that accountability through transparency leads to a lower expected
rate of inflation and less stabilization of supply shocks. Accountability
through shifting final responsibility in the direction of the government
leads to higher inflationary expectations and more stabilization
of supply shocks},

the reliance on cross-county evidence in the empirical literature
risks overemphasizing the importance of cross-county difference in

Data from 58 European regions show significant cross-regional difference

For all regions combined, I find a significant relationship between
the impact of monetary policy and the industrial composition of regions,
supporting earlier findings for the US. I conclude that at present
the large European countries are regionally well-diversified enough
to minimize the risk that ECB policy will produce a markedly different
impact across countries.},

abstract = {Abstract: In this paper, survey data from 20 advanced economies are
used to examine individual preferences about macroeconomic priorities.
The analysis gives rise to three key findings. First, the distributive
consequences of inflation and unemployment are key determinants of
how individuals weigh different economic objectives. New evidence
is provided that nominal asset owners are relatively more inflation
averse, consistent with their exposure to unanticipated inflation.
Second, the findings also suggest that economic context has a substantial
impact on the public's economic objectives in a way broadly consistent
with the specification of utility/loss functions in the theoretical
political economy literature. Third, the results suggest that there
is significant cross-country variation in inflation aversion, controlling
for economic context and individual attributes, and that some of
this variation can be accounted for by national-level factors affecting
the aggregate costs of inflation and unemployment. Cross-country
variation in inflation aversion, controlling for economic context
has significant implications for both optimal monetary policy making
and for models of alternative institutional frameworks for policy-making.},

if there is a non-zero stock of non-monetary nominal public debt,

level, according to which for certain fiscal rules the (initial)
price level is independent of the nominal money stock, is invalid.
It combines an overdetermined fiscal-financial programme with an
unwarranted weakening of the government's inter-temporal budget constraint,
requiring it to hold only in equilibrium, and only for arbitrarily
restricted configurations of public spending, taxes and initial debt
stocks. Third, there is price level determinacy under an exogenous
nominal interest rate rule if the transactions technology has cash-in-advance
features. The price level is hysteretic in this case. Finally, it
is not possible to draw inferences about the historical process of
technological improvements in the transactions technology leading
to a cashless economy, by studying the limiting behaviour, as a transactions
efficiency index takes on successively higher values, of a sequence
of histories, each one of which is indexed for all time by a given

of those scenarios and the implications for economic efficiency (welfare).
We find that the euro may take on some of the current roles of the
dollar. The welfare analysis reveals potential quantitatively significant
benefits for the euro area, at the cost of the US and (to a lesser
degree) Japan.},

rate policy, vis-a-vis a low-inflation country, may provide a source
of discipline, enhancing the disinflation's credibility and reducing
its detrimental impact on the economy. This paper presents empirical
evidence that inflation expectations in Ireland were moderated by
entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system,
indicating that Ireland's disinflation was successful in deriving
credibility from the exchange rate policy. A loss of competitiveness
at an early state of the disinflation appears to have been important
in establishing its credibility.},

We study two fully electronic, highly liquid markets, the Dow an S{\&}P 500 e-mini futures markets. Within these markets, we use a unique dataset of realized trades that includes the precise topology of transactions; this topology allows us to identify precisely both the relevance of network structure as well as endogenous network spillovers. Within these markets, we will show that network positioning on the part of trader leads to remarkable spillovers in return. Empirically, we estimate that the implied average multiplier, the ratio of a individual level shock to the total network one, is as large as 20. A gain of {\$}1 for a trader leads to an average of {\$}20 in gains for all traders and much more for connected ones. In a zero-sum market, such as the one in this study, this suggests a very large re-allocation of returns according to network structure.},

abstract = {Using plausibly exogenous variation in demand for federal funds created by daily shocks to reserve balances, we identify the supply curve facing a bank borrower in the interbank market and study how access to overnight credit is affected by changes in public and private measures of borrower creditworthiness. Although there is evidence that lenders respond to adverse changes in public information about credit quality by restricting access to the market in a fashion consistent with market discipline, there is also evidence that borrowers respond to adverse changes in private information about credit quality by increasing leverage so as to offset the future impact on earnings. While the responsiveness of investors to public information is comforting, we document evidence that suggests that banks are able to manage the real information content of these disclosures. In particular, public measures of loan portfolio performance have information about future loan charge-offs, but only in quarters when the bank is examined by supervisors. However, the loan supply curve is not any more sensitive to public disclosures about nonperforming loans in an exam quarter, suggesting that investors are unaware of this information management.},

This paper uses daily data compiled by the author from the records of the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York over the period March 1, 1984, through December 31, 1996: He analyzes the Desk???s use of its operating procedure in implementing monetary policy and the extent to which open market operations affect the federal funds rate???the liquidity effect. The author finds that the operating procedure was used to guide daily open market operations; however, there is little evidence of a liquidity effect at the daily frequency and even less evidence at lower frequencies. Consistent with the absence of a liquidity effect, open market operations appear to be a relatively unimportant source of liquidity to the federal funds market.

It is important to note that the operating pro- cedure is intended only to provide the Desk with guidance in conducting daily open market oper-ations. It was never intended to be strictly adhered to.
