\noindent I enjoy bringing people together to analyse complex problems using new open source tooling. New methods and technology have the potential to radically change the way we collect, analyse and act upon data. My experience in policy analysis, academic research and hands on involvement in setting up data science units make we well placed to explore these exciting possibilities
