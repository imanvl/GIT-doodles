How to do the simple stuff
Once it is set up:
- git add -all
- git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" --all
- git push -u origin master

If the wrong remote is set
- git remote rm origin
- git remote add orign "URL"

Question:
- How to see what is currently changed: is it easy to compare 2 files?
- work more with master/head etc
